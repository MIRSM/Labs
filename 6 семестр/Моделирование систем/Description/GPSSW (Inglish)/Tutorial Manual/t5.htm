<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This chapter contains a set of sample simulations, by Gerard
F. Cummings and other authors, based on a wide spectrum of applications.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this collection of models, there are examples from traffic
control, inventory control, distribution, assembly, quality control, Flexible
Manufacturing Systems, PBX design, network modeling and many others. Each
example is listed here, followed by a sample report, and a set of suggested
interactions with the simulation. These examples are intended primarily to
present the &quot;artistic&quot; side of a simulation project: how simulation
techniques can be used to capture the essential behavior of a real world system.
It is usually the case that any given process can be modeled in many different
ways, and studying the methods used by experienced professionals is an efficient
way to build one’s own simulation skills.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is desirable to develop a </font><font SIZE="2">&quot;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">feel</font><font SIZE="2">&quot;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
for which factors will have significant effects. You will find that many
suggested changes to a simulated system, are, in fact, ineffective with respect
to many overall system metrics, such as speed or cost. Since realizable designs
to be suggested by the simulation study should not be based on ineffective
changes, it is important to develop a &quot;feel&quot; for the effectiveness of
changes before the final designs are simulated. You should not waste time
studying changes which don’t matter.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In simulation studies it is important to keep track of what
real world behavior and/or data can be taken as given and what is assumed to be
true. Unlike most other disciplines, the experimental nature of simulation
allows you to use </font><font SIZE="2">&quot;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">sensitivity
analysis</font><font SIZE="2">&quot;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> to
examine the effects of error in your assumptions. It may be permissible to
include very inaccurate data, if its accuracy has no effect on the results. On
the other hand, if the results are highly sensitive to missing data, it may be
ill-advised to continue the simulation study unless the proper data can be
obtained. Such relationships can be quantified by preliminary simulations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the burden of the simulation analyst to prove that the
reported results are not due to random variation. Many simulation studies in the
past have reported so-called &quot;effects&quot; which were actually
indistinguishable from random noise. GPSS World makes it easy to perform a first
level statistical analysis. The GPSS World ANOVA command is discussed in Lesson
13 of the last chapter, and in Chapter 6 of the <i>GPSS World Reference Manual</i>.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objective of this chapter is to present the application
of simulation techniques to real world problems. For this reason, the examples
in this chapter have been simplified in two ways.</p>

  <blockquote>
  </font><font FACE="ZapfDingbats" SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">l </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">First, the run times
  have been made much shorter than you would use in a real simulation study.
  Longer runs would lead to less variable results.</p>
  </font><font FACE="ZapfDingbats" SIZE="1">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">l </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Second, in this
  chapter, we have not considered the use of statistical methods, which you
  would apply in any actual application.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sample programs are in the GPSS World Samples Folder. The
examples are named by the corresponding GPSS World Program File names. They are:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recommend that you study each example, then read it into
your GPSS World Simulation Environment, to interact with it. You may then
interactively explore a wide variety of </font><font SIZE="2">&quot;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">What
if?</font><font SIZE="2">&quot;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> scenarios,
starting with the suggested interactions. Feel free to use and explore your own
methods.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point, you might also want to refer to the chart
included in the &quot;How This Manual Describes Actions&quot; section at the
beginning of Chapter 1 of this manual. This chart will tell you how to interpret
the color changes in GPSS World icons.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some GPSS statements are introduced without explanation. You
will need to refer to Chapters 6, 7, and 8 in the <i>GPSS World Reference Manual</i>
for details.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first five examples include detailed discussions of the
programming of each GPSS model. You may want to study these first, and then
proceed to the application(s) that match your own most closely.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can use your mouse to select the Samples folder in the
GPSS World folder by double clicking on it. Then a double click on the sample
you want to run will automatically start a GPSS World Session and open the
selected model or you can</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One additional note: While running GPSS World, files that are
written are placed in the directory where their parent file has been saved. In
other words, a newly created simulation will be saved in the location where the
model file that produced it exists. Reports are written to the location where
the saved simulation exists. If the simulation has not been saved then the
reports are written to the location of the simulation's parent, the model file.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, let's go on and try running some sample models.</p>
