  </font><p ALIGN="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">About this Manual</font></b></p>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">This manual contains information on the use of the GPSS
    World application program, and is the primary reference for the version of
    the GPSS language implemented by GPSS World. The first part of the manual
    shows you all you need to know in order to make full use of the features of
    the GPSS World application program. The last part of the manual contains a
    detailed description of each GPSS Statement and a variety of information
    that may be useful as you become experienced with the use of GPSS World.
    Most of this manual is acessible via the online Help facility of GPSS World.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">A companion manual, entitled <i>GPSS World Tutorial</i>,
    is included in the documentation set. It contains an introduction to
    simulation with GPSS, followed by suggested sessions involving many
    different sample models. You may find one or more examples that correspond
    closely to your own simulation problems.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
  <p align="left">How To Get Started</p>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">If you are familiar with GPSS and do not wish to go through
  all the features offered by GPSS World, after you have installed GPSS World
  according to the instructions in Chapter 2, you should work through the manual
  entitled <i>GPSS World</i></font><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">tm</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  Tutorial</font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Then, as questions arise, refer to the Statement
  descriptions in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of this manual. The Online Help feature
  can save you the trouble of looking up the details of individual Statements.
  You can start the Online Help system by pressing [F1] , by pushing a </font><font FACE="Arial">Help</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  button, or by choosing from the </font><font FACE="Arial">Help</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  menu. You can reach context sensitive help by placing the menu selection
  cursor over the menu item, and then pressing [F1]</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">.</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"></p>
  <p ALIGN="left">To get the maximum benefit of GPSS World, you need to be
  aware of all it has to offer. This is best done by working through the <i>GPSS
  World Tutorial Manual</i>, and then the <i>GPSS World</i></font><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="1">
  </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Reference Manual</font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">.
  We suggest that you experiment with new features until you are comfortable
  with them.</p>

  <p ALIGN="left">Some readers will appreciate the formal grammar description
  in the Appendix. Most of the elements of the GPSS dialect used with GPSS World
  are defined formally there. The forms of an operand which are acceptable are
  given under the appropriate Statement description in Chapter 6, 7, or 8.</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
  <p align="left">How This Manual Describes Actions</p>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">Concepts with meaning specific to GPSS World are
  capitalized. For example, the Current Events Chain is a specific construct
  with a special meaning. When words are used generically, and do not refer to a
  particular item, they are not capitalized.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Actions you are asked to make immediately, are represented
  by verbs in uppercase. For example, when you see PRESS, CHOOSE, CLICK, DOUBLE
  CLICK, SELECT, or TYPE, you are to perform the action, yourself. When actions
  are referred to, but you are not asked to do them immediately, the verbs are
  shown in lower case.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Words representing objects or denoting concepts specific to
  GPSS World, are often shown in italics for emphasis, when first encountered,
  or capitalized when used frequently. For example, SHOW is an Immediate
  Command.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Keystrokes you are required to make are indicated by a
  special font which encloses the name of the key in an outline. For example,
  &quot;PRESS [Enter]&quot;
  means that you are to press the key labeled &quot;Enter&quot; on your
  keyboard.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When more than one key must be used, the key symbols are
  separated by a plus. For example, [Ctrl] + [Alt] + [H] means that you are to press and hold the left key, while you press and release
  the right ones.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Mouse actions are required when the capitalized phrases
  CLICK or DOUBLE CLICK appear. This means that you are to use mouse button 1 to
  perform the action. When mouse button 2 is needed, it will be called for
  explicitly. By default, mouse button 1 is the left mouse button, and 2 the
  right. You can use the OS/2 control panel to switch these assignments.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Menu items are indicated in a bold <b>Times New Roman </b>font<b>.</b>
  When more than one level of selection is necessary, they are shown in the
  order: menu bar item / pull down menu item / cascade menu item. For example</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CHOOSE</font><b><font FACE="Arial"> </font>FILE / OPEN</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">means that you should use either the mouse or the keyboard
  to choose the &quot;File&quot; item in the menu bar. Then you should choose
  the &quot;Open&quot; item in the pull down menu. In this example, there is no
  cascade menu item. For purposes of nomenclature in this manual,
  &quot;CHOOSE&quot; is used for menu items, &quot;SELECT&quot; is used for
  other choices.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Dialog window controls are also shown in a bold </font><b>Times
  New Roman<font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">font.
  For example,</p>

SELECT</font><b><font FACE="Arial"> </font>OK</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">means that you should use either the mouse or the keyboard
  to select the OK button in the dialog window.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When you see SELECT </font><b>OK</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">,
  you can accomplish the same thing pressing [Enter]</font><b><font face="Keycaps" size="4">
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">on
  your keyboard. There is one exception, however. Since </font><b>Command /
  Custom</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> provides for multiline command lists
  and PLUS Procedure definitions, the enter key is used only to break text
  lines, instead of to SELECT </font><b>OK</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Characters you are to type into a Text Window are indicated
  in a bold </font><b><font FACE="Courier New">Courier New</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">font. For example,</p>

TYPE</font><font FACE="Arial"> </font><b><font FACE="Courier New">GENERATE 100</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">means that you are to type the characters &quot;GENERATE
100&quot;, making sure the text window has the focus, and that the text cursor
has been positioned to the right place in the window.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Finally, objects in the operating system shell are described
with <u>underlining</u>, in order to distinguish them from items within GPSS
World, itself. For example,</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DOUBLE CLICK on <u>The GPSS World Icon</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </u>
  <p ALIGN="left">means that you are to view the desktop or a folder of the
  Workplace shell containing the icon which represents the GPSS World Session
  Object, and you are to position the mouse pointer over it and double click
  mouse button 1.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p align="left">Menu Operation</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">You can use either the mouse or the keyboard to choose menu
items. In multistep selections, a selection cursor appears to show you which
item is about to be chosen. A selection cursor is a dotted line or a
&quot;pressed&quot; appearance around a menu item. The [Alt] key, when pressed, will select the first item in the main menu give it a
&quot;pressed&quot; appearance. The arrow keys can then be used to move back and
forth over the menu items. The [Enter] key makes the final selection.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p align="left">Using the Mouse</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">There are two ways to use a mouse to choose a menu item. You
can position the mouse pointer over the item to be chosen, and then press and
release mouse button 1. You can do this in the menu bar, a pull down menu, or a
cascade menu.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Alternately, you can press mouse button 1 and not let up
immediately. Instead, you can drag over the item in the pull down menu, and over
the item in a cascade menu to be chosen, and then release the button. You may
find this combined action quicker, although there are keyboard shortcuts, as
well.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p align="left">Using the Keyboard</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">The keyboard alone can be used to make menu choices. If any
menu actions are in process, press <b>^</b>. Then press <b>a</b> to position the
menu selection cursor on the first item in the menu bar.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Now you can move the selection cursor by using the arrow
keys, [Home] or [End]. Press [Enter] to make the final menu item choice.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Alternately, you may be able to simply press a mnemonic key.
These keys are denoted by the underlined letters occurring in the menu items.
After entering keyboard selection mode by PRESSing [Alt]
you can press mnemonic keys to choose succeeding menu items.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Finally, some items have shortcut key combinations listed in
the menu, to the right of the item. You can immediately choose a menu item,
simply by pressing this key combination. Of course, for you to be able to do
this, that window has to have the focus.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p align="left">Text Windows</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">When a GPSS World Text Window has the focus, keystrokes
usually cause the replacement or insertion of characters into the window. The
[Ins]
key can be used to change between insert mode and replace mode. The mode is
indicated by the shape of the blinking text cursor, which also indicates the
insertion point in the window.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Either the keyboard or the mouse can move the text cursor.
Clinking mouse button 1 moves the text cursor to the position under the mouse
pointer. The arrow keys, [Home], [End], [PgUp], and [PgDn] all move the text cursor, as does normal text insertion and deletion.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">A new line of text can be started by pressing [Enter].</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Selected text is shown in inverse, and can take part in
special operations. You can select text by dragging mouse button 1 over the
target text, by pressing j, and clicking mouse button 1 on the end of selected
text, or by double clicking on the word to be selected.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">You can delete characters, one at a time, by pressing [Del]
or backspace. Pressing [Del]
deletes the character to the right of the cursor; pressing backspace deletes the
character to the left of the cursor. Selected text can be deleted by choosing </font><b><font FACE="Arial">Edit
/ Cut</font></b><font FACE="Arial"> </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">, or by
pressing [Del]
. A single level undo is available by choosing </font><b><font FACE="Arial">Edit
/ Undo</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> .</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p align="left">Graphics Windows</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">Graphics Windows may have menu actions based on the selection
of one or more objects in the window. For example, a contiguous sequence of
Blocks can be copied form the Block Input Window to the clipboard.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Generally, an object can be selected by clicking on its icon.
Swipe selection is supported, as well. In addition, some windows allow extended
selection. First select an object. Then scroll to the other end of the selection
set of objects, hold down [Shift]
while clicking on the second object. That object, the first object, and all
intervening objects will then be selected.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Finally, if you hold down [Ctrl]
while clicking on an icon, the object is toggled into or out of the selection
set. A selected object becomes unselected, or an unselected object becomes
selected.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p align="left">Dialog Windows</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">Although the GPSS World dialog windows are all different,
they do have some things in common.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Mouse selection is normally used to set the focus in entry
fields, and make selections in each dialog. Usually, the [Enter] key will select
</font><b><font FACE="Arial">OK</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">,
the [Esc]
key will select </font><b><font FACE="Arial">Cancel</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">,
and the [F1]
key will select </font><b><font FACE="Arial">Help</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">.</p>

<p align="left">Universal Keys</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">Several keys, and key combinations are effective no matter
which GPSS World window has the focus. They are generally used to control a
translated simulation by quickly passing Commands to the active Simulation
Server.</p>
<blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial">
<p align="left">Hot Keys</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">The Hot Keys initiate an Interactive Command from a single

<blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE="Arial">
<p align="left">Function Keys</p>
</blockquote>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">Function keys can be given ad hoc assignments. You can do
this in the Settings Notebook by typing in the new assignment beside the
appropriate function key label. Thereafter, when you press the associated
function key, the assigned Command is Translated and sent to the Server. You can
assign a complex Command List and/or PLUS Procedure redefinition by assigning an
INCLUDE Statement to a function key.</p>

<p align="left">Intended Audience</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is a full strength simulation environment designed
for simulation professionals. A significant amount of preparation is required
before you can expect to use it to its full potential. This manual is intended
for users who are already familiar with the basic elements of the GPSS language.
In addition, you are expected to know how to operate your personal computer
system. You are expected to know about the file system, disk drives,
directories, diskettes, desktop objects, and how to use a mouse. Also, you are
expected to know how to operate menus and dialogs by mouse and/or keyboard. This
information is available in the documentation of your operating system.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">If you are a GPSS/PC user, be sure to read the section
entitled <u>GPSS World Features</u> in Chapter One. It goes over a detailed list
of features and changes from the old GPSS/PC environment. More information for
each item exists in later chapters. Be sure to refer through the index when you
need to know more about any individual item. Online Help and the online
Reference Manual are available, as well.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">If you are new to GPSS, the General Purpose Simulation
System, you should do some preliminary work before you continue with this
manual. First, you should read one of the excellent books on the GPSS language.
Then, you should carefully work through the companion user manual, entitled <i>GPSS
World Tutorial Manual</i>.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Afterward, you should read the first 4 chapters of this
manual, using the remaining chapters as reference material. This course of study
will place all the interactive power of GPSS World at your fingertips. It is
best to restrict yourself to a subset of the GPSS language until you gain some
actual model building experience. Most GPSS modelers are productive without
mastering all the Blocks available in the language. However, you will be most
effective by considering simulation methodology, and the GPSS language, to be a
topic of continuing study.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">You should become familiar with both the Online Help
facilities and the online reference manual. Both are handy for quick references,
and for providing answers to specific questions.</p>
