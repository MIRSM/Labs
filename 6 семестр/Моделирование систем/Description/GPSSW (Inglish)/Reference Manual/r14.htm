Introduction</font></b></h2>
<font FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="left">There are many conditions that can prevent the normal
completion of an operation. They can occur from operation of the menus, during
Translation of a Model, or during the running of a Simulation.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Errors that occur as you initiate Commands and environmental
operations appear immediately and prevent the operation from beginning. They
require you to correct a condition or select a different operation. The other
two categories of error generally are fixed by alterations in your Model.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Syntax errors can occur when you translate a Model or
Command. To fix ones that occur in a Model translation you can use <b>Search /
Next Error </b>or<b> Search / Previous Error </b> to move the cursor directly to
the faulty Statement. If an error occurs in an Include-file, you can get better
diagnostic messages by temporarily placing those statements in a Model Object.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Errors that occur within the Simulation are called Error
Stops. They cause the Simulation to enter the Halted state, and if an Experiment
is in progress it is aborted. Usually Error Stop messages tell you where the
error is to be corrected in the Model, but the <b>Search / Next Error</b>
 feature
is not available for them. Instead, the Include-file number (the Model is file
number 0) and the text-line number is given in the error message. The <b>Edit /
Goto</b> menu command can usually be used to find and correct these errors.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Sometimes you will need to do some investigation in order to
find the error. If the source of the error is not apparent, you may want to stop
the simulation at a specific place and then use the SHOW Command and open
Windows and Snapshots to see what happened.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">For troublesome Error Stops you may want to use the Blocks
window and the debug toolbar. Then you can place a Stop condition that causes a
stop just before when the error condition occurs, Then use interactive SHOW
commands to evaluate all suspected operands. When a condition occurs late in a
simulation, you may find it convenient to save the Simulation object just before
the simulated time when the error is due to occur. This can save time when you
must rerun a late part of the simulation a few times in the diagnostic process.
You can keep reopening that saved Simulation instead of rerunning the simulation
to the error point.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The major error messages are listed next in alphabetic order
with an additional explanation. Where you see <i>XXX</i> in the message it means
that the error message contains a phrase that depends on the details of the
error condition. Admittedly some messages arise from more than one context. In
that case the explanation is based on what we think is the most common way the
message can occur.</p>
