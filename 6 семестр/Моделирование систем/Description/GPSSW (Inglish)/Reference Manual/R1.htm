        <p ALIGN="left">Predicting the behavior of complex real world systems
        -- that's what GPSS World is all about.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Many expensive projects in the past have failed
        because the end result was not characterized accurately. From maximum
        capacity to cost of operation, it is essential for detailed knowledge of
        the behavior of the system under construction to be known as soon as
        possible. Although purely mathematical models are extremely valuable,
        and should be used where feasible, the complexity of most real world
        systems requires the use of computer simulation to get the necessary
        answers. That's where GPSS World comes in.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is based on the seminal language of
        computer simulation, GPSS, which stands for General Purpose Simulation
        System. This language was developed primarily by Geoffrey Gordon at IBM
        around 1960, and has contributed important concepts to every commercial
        discrete event Computer Simulation Language developed ever since. GPSS
        World is a direct descendent of GPSS/PC, an early implementation of GPSS
        for personal computers. Since it's introduction in 1984, GPSS/PC and its
        successors have saved thousands of users millions of dollars. Now, the
        Windows implementation of GPSS World extends these capabilities into an
        Internet aware environment.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is designed to deliver answers quickly and
        reliably, with the least effort, achieving the highest reliability of
        results. Consistent with these objectives, visualization of running
        simulations is highly stylized and a default statistical treatment is
        built in. This approach means that animations are &quot;free&quot;
        requiring no additional effort to produce, but are not photo-realistic.
        GPSS World's forte is transparency, not photo-realism. Third party
        animation systems are available which can provide pictorial animations
        based on GPSS World simulations.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Transparency is valuable for three reasons. First, it
        is dangerous to rely on an opaque &quot;Black-Box&quot; simulation whose
        internal mechanisms cannot be observed. Not only can you not be sure it
        fits your situation, but it is difficult to be assured that it even
        works as intended. Second, successful simulations are valuable and have
        a surprisingly long lifetime. It is possible that new staff members will
        be required to become familiar with the internal workings of the
        simulation -- a near-impossible task unless provision has already been
        made for a high level of transparency. Third, one of the most effective
        but least mentioned benefits of computer simulation is the insight on
        system behavior achieved when an experienced simulation professional can
        see the internal dynamics at crucial times in the simulation.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World was designed to address these issues. Its
        visualizable nature allows the internal mechanisms of models to be
        revealed and captured. Its interactivity allows one to explore and
        manipulate simulations. Its built-in data analysis facility can
        calculate confidence intervals and an Analysis of Variance easily. And
        now, it can even create and run sophisticated screening and optimization
        experiments automatically, with relatively little effort from you.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Most systems can be modeled in any of several ways
        using GPSS World. Usually only a small subset of the features available
        need to be used. However, the greatest proficiency requires familiarity
        with all that GPSS World has to offer. This manual is the primary source
        of that information.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">This chapter consists of 5 sections. The first is a
        brief overview of the most important aspects of GPSS World. The second
        explores a few basic concepts that are necessary for moving on to later
        chapters. The third section discusses the advanced architecture of GPSS
        World and what you must know to take advantage of it. The fourth section
        explores the modeling language of GPSS World, and the fifth section is
        for GPSS/PC users who want to take advantage of the Compatibility Mode
        of GPSS World. This last feature is available only in the Commercial
        Version of GPSS World.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Installation and operating procedures are discussed
        in Chapter 2.</p>

        Highlights</font></h2>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is object oriented. Its inhabitants
        include Model Objects which are used to create Simulation Objects.
        Simulation Objects, in turn, are used to play out simulations and create
        Report Objects. Finally, Text Objects can be used as Include-files to
        support code sharing and a user source code library and they are often
        used as files which can be read from or written to by the simulation.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Simulation projects require several steps. They
        normally include model building and data collection, testing and
        verification, simulation, experimentation, and the analysis of results.
        GPSS World has a large number of capabilities addressing each of these
        steps. In GPSS World, you will create and modify a model using the
        full-screen text editor. If you prefer, you can insert GPSS Block
        Statements using special Block Input Dialogs where you just fill in the
        blanks. The resulting Block Statements are placed sequentially at the
        insertion point in your Model Object. You then Create a Simulation
        Object by selecting <b>Command / Create Simulation</b> in the Main
        Window Menu. Thereafter, you have a powerful set of Commands at your
        disposal to control the running of the simulation. You can enter
        Commands interactively, or you can include them in the original model.
        During the testing and verification phase, a large number of window
        types are available for online viewing and to take snapshots of the
        simulation. Hot Keys and Point and Shoot breakpoint control makes
        verification and debugging easy. After the simulation is tested, you can
        use the Automatic Experiment Generators or you can design your own
        experiments. GPSS World will help you every step of the way.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World was designed to exploit your computing
        environment. The use of virtual memory allows your models to grow to a
        billion bytes. Preemptive multitasking and multithreading mean higher
        responsiveness and permit GPSS World to be doing many things at the same
        time. It also means that the simulation environment can utilize the
        computing capacity of <u>S</u>ymmetric <u>M</u>ulti-<u>P</u>rocessing
        architectures.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">The structure of the modeling language has been
        simplified in GPSS World. A Model is now defined as a sequence of Model
        Statements. Each can be a GPSS Statement or a PLUS Procedure definition
        (possibly a PLUS Experiment definition). A Model Object is used to
        create the corresponding Simulation Object, which can then be activated.
        Any Model Statement can be sent to an existing Simulation Object. Such
        statements are called Interactive Statements. These concepts are
        discussed in more detail in the next section.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">New in GPSS World are the GPSS Block creation
        dialogs. These are great in a teaching environment. Using the <b>Edit /
        Insert Block</b> menu command, you can open the Block Menu Window which
        has a button for each GPSS Block. Passing your mouse over each button is
        all you need to do to see a description of that Block. When you click on
        a button, a Dialog opens with all the details you need to create a GPSS
        Block. Just fill in the blanks. The Help button takes you to the
        appropriate place in the Reference Manual describing the block. When you
        click OK the resulting block is inserted in the Model Object. Don't
        worry, any syntax errors are reported immediately so you can correct
        them on the spot. For formatting purposes, the inserted GPSS Block
        Statements contain tabs. You can alter the tabstops to your liking in
        the Settings of the Model Object. In any event, since inserted Block
        Statements and PLUS Experiments are in the form of source code, you can
        always edit them before Creating the Simulation Object.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">The simulation language within GPSS World has been
        extended by PLUS, the <u>P</u>rogramming <u>L</u>anguage <u>U</u>nder <u>S</u>imulation.
        This simple but powerful programming language removes the restrictions
        that existed in the older GPSS implementations. Data within this
        environment are untyped, with conversions occurring automatically as
        needed. In addition, powerful function and probability distribution
        libraries are directly available to be used in PLUS Expressions. The
        Procedure Library supports string manipulations, numeric calculations
        and probability distributions. User written PLUS Procedures can be used
        in the same way. An INCLUDE Command can bring in existing User Procedure
        Libraries containing tested PLUS Procedures for use throughout the
        simulation.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">User-defined PLUS Procedures and can be accessed
        anywhere in the Model. Expressions, defined in PLUS, can incorporate
        data elements and System Numeric Attributes. When parenthesized, PLUS
        Expressions can appear outside PLUS Procedures, in GPSS Statements. In
        fact, most arguments in the GPSS Statements can now be in the form of a
        parenthesized expression.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">In Version 4 of GPSS World, the PLUS Language has
        been extended for definition of Experiments. This powerful feature
        permits programmable control and can even be based on simulation
        results. Thus, completely automatic operation is possible including the
        exploration of response surfaces. PLUS Experiments, which are invoked by
        the CONDUCT Command, can be used to control the running of simulations
        over a parameter space. Experiments can be created with minimal
        involvement on your part. GPSS World now includes two new powerful
        experiment generators that can be accessed through the Edit Menu of the
        Main Window. The Screening Experiment Generator will create a fractional
        factorial experiment under your direction, and insert its PLUS source
        code into your model. Similarly, the Optimizing experiment generator
        will insert a sophisticated response surface exploration experiment that
        searches for minimum or maximum yields. The CONDUCT Command necessary to
        initiate the experiments is by default loaded into a Function Key. To
        execute a Screening or Optimizing Experiment and analyze the results,
        all you have to do is press a button.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World has comprehensive discrete and continuous
        modeling capabilities. The tightly knit continuous modeling feature
        allows for easy transition between the continuous and the discrete
        phases. From the continuous phase thresholds can be established that
        trigger the creation of Transactions for the discrete phase. Conversely,
        the INTEGRATION Block and INTEGRATE Command, control the processing in
        the continuous phase.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Several new GPSS Blocks have been added to cover the
        control of integrations, Transaction rescheduling, changes to Assembly
        Sets, user-defined PLUS Blocks, and Data Streams. Data types now include
        integer and real numeric values, as well as strings. Each type is
        automatically coerced to the required form, as needed. The new data type
        &quot;UNSPECIFIED&quot; now is available to indicate the absence of
        valid data, such as that from a missing run of an experiment.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Even matrix structures have been improved. They can
        now incorporate up to 6 dimensions. The new multiway ANOVA Library
        Procedure analyzes data from a &quot;Result Matrix&quot;, which is
        nothing more than a GPSS Matrix Entity where the yields of an experiment
        have been stored in a conventional way.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is easy to operate. A full screen text
        editor can be used in any of the Text Windows. Even the Journal Window
        and Reports can be customized and annotated. You can use bookmarks as
        placeholders in any text window. Then since a single keystroke takes you
        to successive bookmarks, jumping from place to place in a large Model is
        a trivial matter. When you Create a Simulation, if any errors are
        detected, they are remembered so that you can correct them one at a
        time. When you go to each successive error, the cursor moves
        automatically to the location in the Model where the error was detected
        to help you locate each problem. After the Simulation is Created,
        several Hot Keys can be used in place of Interactive Commands. Not only
        that, using Model and Simulation Settings, you can load your own
        Commands into one or more function keys in order to get single keystroke
        response. Windows are easy to open. Generally, only a menu selection is
        needed. During debugging, the Debug Toolbar allows even breakpoint
        control to be accomplished in a Point and Shoot fashion.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">It’s easy to visualize running simulations. GPSS
        World can create stylized animations of any GPSS entity type with no
        more than a mouse click or two, from you. These windows are dynamic --
        showing the changing state of running simulations. In several different
        ways, you can view the changing condition of any GPSS entity. In
        addition to the entity specific views, one or more Expression Windows
        can be opened to display the changing values of any number of your own
        Expressions. For visualization of any of the variables in your
        simulation, any number of scrollable PLOT Windows can be opened to show
        dynamics graphically. And finally, the Table Window opens a changing
        view of any frequency distribution you care to see.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World provides for a set of snapshots, as well.
        These are advanced features intended for professionals who need detailed
        knowledge of microstates of the simulation. Static snapshots can be
        taken of any Transaction, the Future Events Chain, the Current Events
        Chain, or the membership of the Numeric and Transaction Groups.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is highly interactive. All Model
        Statements can be used interactively. When you send a Command, Block
        Statement, Procedure Definition, or Experiment Definition to an existing
        Simulation Object, the interaction is used to redefine or manipulate the
        state of the simulation. This level of control is useful while the
        behavior of the simulation is being verified. In essence, you can do
        almost anything, except Block insertion, to the simulation after it is
        created.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">Simulations can communicate with the outside world.
        You can now use five new GPSS Blocks and/or PLUS Procedures to
        manipulate Data Streams. They are OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE, and SEEK.
        The last of these, SEEK, provides for direct access into a database.
        Data Streams have many purposes. You can use them to access data files,
        to create Result Files and custom reports, to access internal data
        directly. There are now PLUS Library Routines with the same names that
        perform nearly the same functions. That means that complex I/O
        operations can now be handled inside User-created PLUS Procedures. GPSS
        World simulations can even communicate with other products by direct
        invocation. The PLUS Procedure Library now contains the <b>Call()</b>, <b>Call_Integer()</b>,
        <b>Call_String(), </b>and the <b>Call_Real()</b> procedures which can
        invoke external functions existing on your system in executable files
        (i.e. EXE and DLL files). These features are described in Chapter 8.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">The analysis of results is easy in GPSS World. It has
        facilities that support the capture and printing of graphical windows.
        The Journal Window records the activities associated with the Simulation
        Object. An automatic Report numbering system ensures the safe keeping of
        each Standard Report. The new ANOVA Library Procedure can perform a
        complete multiway Analysis of Variance when passed a Result Matrix.
        That's all there is to the generation of an ANOVA table and a set of
        Confidence Intervals. And now, the Automatic Experiment Generators can
        create sophisticated screening and optimizing experiments based on
        dialog-window input from you. The basic analyses of these experiments
        are done automatically and reported in the Journal Window.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">A new Batch Mode of operation can be used to run
        simulations in the background. If you specify a Model File or a
        Simulation File on the DOS command line followed by the word
        &quot;BATCH&quot;, GPSS World will run in a minimized window. It first
        opens the file and then passes it a Create Command (if a Model Object)
        or a CONTINUE Command (if a Simulation Object). In the former case, you
        would normally append the desired run control Commands in the Model
        itself. You can use the new EXIT 1 Command (or Exit(1) Library
        Procedure) to shut down the resulting Session by itself, automatically
        saving all the newly created or modified Objects. EXIT is discussed in
        Chapter 6.</p>
        <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World does inherit some characteristics from
        GPSS/PC. For example, normally it retains the use of the </font><font FACE="Keycaps" SIZE="4">#
        </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">character as the multiplication
        operator, reserving the </font><font FACE="Keycaps" SIZE="4">*</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
        character for GPSS Indirect Addressing. You can switch the function of
        these characters so that </font><font FACE="Keycaps" SIZE="4">*</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
        denotes multiplication, if you like, by changing a Model Setting.
        Although GPSS Statements, except Function Followers, must still fit on a
        single line of text, the maximum line length has been increased to 250
        characters. PLUS Statements are not so restricted. They can span any
        number of lines.

        GPSS World Concepts</font></h2>
    <b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5">
      </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is populated by 4 kinds of objects. Model,
      Simulation, and Report Objects form the 3 basic types that are used in all
      GPSS World simulations. Typically, a Model is developed by editing the
      statements in a Model Object. Then, a Create Simulation Command is issued,
      thereby creating a Simulation Object structured according to the
      statements in the Model. Simulations are run by sending them GPSS
      Commands, or by including commands in the Model Object, itself. Normally,
      when a simulation completes, a Report Object is created automatically.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Overall control of multiple simulation runs can be
      handled within this framework by including a PLUS Experiment in the Model
      Object. (PLUS is the &quot;<u>P</u>rogramming <u>L</u>anguage <u>U</u>nder
      <u>S</u>imulation&quot; that can be used to define procedures and
      experiments.) Then, a CONDUCT Command can be sent to the Simulation Object
      to control a series of simulation runs, and deal with the results.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The Text Object completes the 4 types of GPSS World
      Objects. These are named in INCLUDE Statements to aid the development of
      large simulations, and for a few other handy uses such as the creation of
      a source code library. In addition, Text Objects are often used by
      Simulation Objects, when OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE, and SEEK operations are
      performed.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">All GPSS World Objects can be saved at any time, in any
      state, and reopened in a later session. This includes Simulation Objects,
      which can be run any number of times from a saved state, thereby
      facilitating debugging and demonstrations. With some careful planning,
      Simulation Objects can be saved in the middle of complex Experiments,
      allowing you to complete the simulation runs at a later time.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">All GPSS World Objects except Text Objects contain data
      in addition to the basic ASCII text. This is why you can use an external
      text editor to edit a Text Object, but not any of the others. Model,
      Simulation, and Report Objects contain Bookmarks for easy navigation, and
      a list of attribute values called Settings, which can be modified and are
      inherited by child objects. When a Simulation Object is Created it begins
      with a copy of the Settings of the Model that created it. The same goes
      for Report Objects which inherit their settings from the parent Simulation
      Object. In addition, Model Objects remember all the Translation errors
      encountered the last time you tried to Create a Simulation Object from it.
      That way you can make some corrections and save the rest for later.</p>
      </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
      <p align="left">Model Objects</p>
      </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="left">A Model Object contains primarily a sequence of Model
      Statements and a set of built-in values called Settings. In addition, a
      set of Bookmarks and a circular Result List of syntax errors are part of
      the Model Object. When a Simulation Object is Created by Translating the
      Statements in a Model, it inherits all the Settings from the parent Model
      Object. The <b>Command / Create Simulation</b> menu command in the Main
      Window is used to create a new Simulation Object.</p>
      <blockquote>
      </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
      <p align="left">Model Statements</p>
      </blockquote>
      </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="left">A Model is the set of all statements contained in a
      Model Object and all its Include-files. A Model Statement can be either a
      GPSS Statement, or a PLUS Procedure definition. GPSS Statements, in turn,
      can be either Block Statements or Commands. Model Statements define a
      Simulation Object when it is first Translated, and they can be sent as
      interactions to an existing simulation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Commands are either <i>Queued</i> or <i>Immediate</i>.
      Actually, all Commands except HALT and SHOW are Queued. Each Simulation
      Object has a special chain called a Command Queue that holds all Queued
      Commands received by the Simulation Object. Commands are taken off the
      Command Queue, one after the other, for execution.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The HALT Command is a special case. It is an Immediate
      Command, and therefore is not placed on the simulation’s Command Queue.
      However, when a HALT is executed, all remaining Commands are removed from
      the Command Queue and discarded. This ensures that all action on behalf of
      the simulation ceases when a HALT is received. Normally, a HALTed
      simulation is resumed by sending it a CONTINUE Command.</p>
      <blockquote>
      </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
      <p align="left">Multiple Model Files</p>
      </blockquote>
      </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="left">Usually, a Model is the set of Statements in a single
      Model Object, and optionally, any number of plain text files, called Text
      Objects. It is sometimes useful to place a sequence of one or more
      Statements, PLUS Procedures, and/or PLUS Experiments into one or more
      separate Text Objects in order to modularize the model.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Text Objects, which are plain text files, can be named
      in INCLUDE Statements in the Model Object. Doing so causes all Statements
      in the Text Object to be inserted in place of the INCLUDE Command when the
      Simulation Object is created. Text Objects may themselves may contain
      INCLUDE Statements, to a maximum nesting level of 5. INCLUDE Commands can
      be used interactively, as well as within Models. They can even be loaded
      into Function Keys, thereby invoking a complex sequence with a single
      keystroke. This is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">A Model is built from the Statements in exactly one
      Model Object and optionally any (nonnegative) number of Text Objects,
      which are mentioned in INCLUDE Statements encountered during the
      Translation of the Model. Only the Model Object can have Settings
      associated with it, which can be accessed through the Main Window's <b>Edit
      / Settings</b> menu command. These Settings are inherited by all
      Simulation Objects Created from that Model Object. To prevent the
      occurrence of multiple Settings, Model Objects may not be used in INCLUDE
      Statements, only Text Objects.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">There are two kinds of numbering associated with files.
      Model and Include-files are numbered internally so they can be referenced
      by Status Messages coming from the simulation. The number is the
      0-relative ordinal of the file in the order encountered by the Translator
      when the Simulation Object was created. For example, the primary Model
      Object is assigned Model File Number 0 and the Include-files are numbered
      as they are encountered starting with 1. This numbering is for
      identification in error messages only. A different numbering system is
      applied to newly created simulation and report files in order to keep the
      file names distinct. You can set the numbering of the filenames of child
      objects within the Settings of the parent object. For example, to change
      the numbering of simulation filenames, you should edit the Settings of the
      parent Model Object. Similarly, edit the Settings of the Simulation Object
      to set the numbering of its child Report Objects.</p>

      <p ALIGN="left">Each Model Object carries with it a set of choices
      called Model Settings, or simply &quot;Settings&quot;. These are
      accessible using the <b>Edit / Settings</b> menu command in the Main
      Window's menu. Settings are inherited by the Simulation Object, and also
      by the resulting Report Objects. Some settings can be changed even after
      the Simulation Object is created. The details are in Chapter 2.</p>

      <p ALIGN="left">A Simulation Object is created by translating the

      item is used for this purpose. After a Simulation Object is created
      successfully, commands are then used to advance the state of the
      simulation. These Commands can be part of the Model Object, or they can be
      sent to the existing Simulation Object as interactions.</p>

      Statements are Translated before they are incorporated into the
      simulation. Similarly, interactions are Translated in global scope before
      they are sent to an existing Simulation Object.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">When errors occur which prevent a Simulation Object
      from being Created, a list of messages is placed in the Model Object.
      Then, you can move to the next error message by a mouse click in the <b>Search
      / Next Error</b> menu item or using accelerator keys. Each error is
      described in the Status Line at the bottom of the Main Window and the
      mouse cursor jumps to the location in the Model text where you can correct
      the error. Correcting and retranslating is quick and easy. There is a
      special command, <b>Command / Retranslate</b>, for retranslating the Model

      <p align="left">Report Objects</p>
      </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="left">One of the strongest features of GPSS has always been
      its Standard Reports. With essentially no effort from the model developer,
      a simulation run automatically reports on all the GPSS Entities defined in
      the model when the simulation's Termination Count reaches zero. There are
      a variety of ways of customizing these reports by Editing the Settings in
      the Simulation Object.</p>

      <p align="left">Text Objects</p>
      </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="left">A Text Object is simply a way to represent a plain text
      file in GPSS World. Their primary use is as the target of INCLUDE
      Commands. This allows a shared set of Model Statements to be accessed
      easily from a Model Object. You can even load an INCLUDE Statement into a
      function key. In that way, a complex Command list and/or PLUS Procedure in
      a text file can be sent to a Simulation with a single keystroke.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Text Objects turn up in other places, as well. Data
      Streams allow a Simulation to read and write data from text files, and to
      create Result Files for later analysis. As you might expect, these files
      are all represented as Text Objects.</p>

      of the Document/View architecture common to Windows</font><font SIZE="1">tm</font><font SIZE="2">
      applications. Objects can be opened with multiple views, modified, and
      saved to persistent memory according to highly intuitive action sequences
      on the part of the user. The familiar main window menu and the disabling
      of inappropriate menu commands guides the user to his/her objective with
      minimal distractions. Internally, GPSS World has been designed to take
      advantage of close interactivity even in a multitasking virtual memory
      environment. This is discussed next.</font></font></p>

      The Multithreaded-design of GPSS World allows it to run
      multiple simulations and experiments simultaneously. Not only is screen
      update, user input, disk Input/Output, printing, and simulation done

      Simulations are not directly limited to the size of the
      physical random access memory (RAM) where the Simulation Object is run.
      Using virtual memory, simulations can be up a gigabyte in size. No other
      direct entity limits are imposed, assuming adequate swap space is
      provided. For optimum performance, however, sufficient real memory must be
      available. All

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      GPSS World maintains a high level of interactivity with
      your simulations. You can send any Model Statement to an existing
      Simulation Object, using the Command item on the main menu of the Model
      Window, Accelerator Keys, or by using Model Settings to load function keys
      with your own customized Commands. You can use the Custom Command Dialog
      for statements not on the drop down menu, and using an INCLUDE command,
      you can send an interaction of any complexity to a simulation. Even
      INCLUDE Commands can be loaded into Function Keys, thereby supporting
      iterations of any complexity invoked by a single keystroke.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Block Statements, when used interactively, cause the
      Active Transaction to attempt to enter a temporary block, which is then
      discarded. This mode is called Manual Simulation Mode and it is useful
      during Experiments, providing all the functions available inside the
      simulation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">PLUS Procedure and Experiment Statements case a
      user-defined procedure or experiment to be registered in the simulation’s
      Procedure Library. Any existing Procedure item of the same name and type
      is replaced.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Commands, except for HALT and SHOW, when received by an
      existing Simulation Object, are placed on the simulation’s Command Queue
      to be executed in turn. HALT and SHOW are Immediate Commands, and are
      executed immediately when first received by the simulation. In addition,
      HALT removes all waiting Commands from the Command Queue. CONDUCT Commands
      initiate a PLUS Experiment that takes over control of the Simulation
      Object. Experiments can base decisions on results and invoke a statistical
      analysis, however interactivity is reduced during an Experiment.</p>

    <font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World excels in the visualization of running
      simulations. Consistent with the generality of the GPSS language, twenty
      different windows are available for observation of and interaction with
      your simulations. No additional effort beyond operating the windows is
      necessary to obtain, save, and print a visual representation of the state
      of the simulation. Whereas, Simulation Snapshots a one-time static picture
      of a quickly changing entity, Simulation Windows are updated online,
      dynamically changing to keep current with the changing state of the
      running simulation. Although the dynamic windows show the changing state
      of entities, they also cause simulations to run more slowly.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Many windows have a non-detailed view and a detailed
      view which show alternate sets of information. Others allow you to display
      a running numerical simulation clock at the bottom of the Main Window. You
      make the choices using the View item on the Main Window's menu bar.</p>

      The Modeling Language</font></h2>

      <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World contains an implementation of GPSS, the <u>G</u>eneral
      <u>P</u>urpose <u>S</u>imulation <u>S</u>ystem, enhanced by an embedded
      programming language PLUS, <u>P</u>rogramming <u>L</u>anguage <u>U</u>nder
      <u>S</u>imulation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The GPSS variant includes over 50 Block Statements and
      25 Commands. It includes over 35 System Numeric Attributes, which provide
      instant state variables, accessible anywhere in the model.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">PLUS is a small but powerful procedural programming
      language created out of only 12 statement types. Much of its power comes
      from a large procedure library containing mathematical and string
      manipulation functions, and a strong set of probability distributions.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">In GPSS World, a Model is defined to be a sequence of
      Model Statements. These are either GPSS Statements, PLUS Procedure
      Statements, or PLUS Experiment Statements. GPSS Statements, in turn, are
      either Block Statements or Commands. Except for Function Follower
      Statements, all GPSS Statements must reside on a single text line of up to
      250 characters. Any Model Statement can be part of the model in a Model
      File, or can be sent interactively to modify an existing simulation.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">The inclusion of Expressions in PLUS Statements and
      Parenthesized Expressions in GPSS Statements is a strong enhancement to
      the modeling power and ease of use of the language. The use of the [*]
      character to denote multiplication has been retained as the default. This
      clearly distinguishes that arithmetic operation from the GPSS indirect
      addressing operation which is denoted by the [*]
      character. However, you can now switch the role of these operators if you
      prefer. This is done on Page 1 of the Settings Notebook of the Model
      Object.</p>
      <p ALIGN="left">Commands are discussed in Chapter 6, Block Statements

      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Many changes have been made to the modeling language.
      The distinction of Control Statements has been removed. All GPSS
      Statements that are not Block Statements are now simply called Commands.
      Line numbers are ignored in GPSS World. If used, they must begin in the
      first column of the text line.
        </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Automatic truncations have been removed from GPSS
      World. You must now explicitly use the INT( ) procedure, or some other
      method, if you wish intermediate numeric results to be truncated. This is
      true in all Expressions, even in VARIABLE and BVARIABLE Statements.
      Similarly, the data type returned by a System Numeric Attribute can now be
      integer, real, or string, depending on the SNA. Even those SNAs returning
      parts per thousand do so as a real number of double precision between 0
      and 1000, inclusively. The old truncations and integer SNAs can be
      enforced by running a Commercial Version of GPSS World in GPSS/PC
      Compatibility Mode, which is discussed below.
        </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      PLUS Statements can span any number of text lines.
      Although GPSS Statements, except for Function Followers, must reside on a
      single text line, the maximum length is now 250 characters.
        </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Parenthesized mathematical expressions can now be used
      nearly anywhere you can use an SNA. Expressions are an integral part of
      the PLUS Language, but they are also used to expand the power of operands
      in GPSS Statements. The permissible forms of each operand are given in the
      statement descriptions in Chapters 6 and 7. Many new statement types have
      been added, as well. These are discussed next.

      GPSS World provides for a range of language elements
      for convenience in the development of complex simulations.

      <p align="left">Polymorphic Data Types</p>
      </font></b>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Variables can now take on values with one of four
      types. User controlled variables, such as Savevalues, Matrix Elements,
      Transaction Parameters, and User Variables can take on integer, real,
      string, or UNSPECIFIED values. Clock values are integer or real, in double
      precision.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Conversion between types is automatic. Procedures that
      require a specific data type as an argument will coerce the argument to
      the appropriate type. If you pass a string to a Procedure that requires a
      numeric argument, the numeric equivalent of the string is used. Similarly,
      if you attempt to WRITE a numeric value, it is converted to a line of text
      automatically.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      String values have many uses. They can be used in Data
      Streams, to format reports and Result Files, and internally for direct
      access of data. String constants are denoted by enclosure of the string in
      a pair of double quotes. You can use two double quotes together to
      represent a single double quote internal to the string. For example, you
      would use a total of 6 double quote characters to represent a string
      within a string. The inner string would be &quot;sandwiched&quot; by two
      pairs of double quotes, and the overall string would be
      &quot;sandwiched&quot; by a double quote character on each end. Procedure
      Library contains many string procedures that can be used to create and
      manipulate strings.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      You can now give the Data Type 'UNSPECIFIED' to
      Savevalue Entities, and Matrix Entities. The INITIAL Command allows you to
      assign this type to Savevalues, Matrix elements, and even whole Matrices
      at once. If an UNSPECIFIED datum is used in an operation that requires a
      value, an Error Stop will occur. The ANOVA Library Procedure has been
      upgraded to recognize UNSPECIFIED elements in a Result Matrix as
      unavailable experimental run results.

      GPSS World features a new high performance model
      Translator that is hundreds of times faster than its predecessor. The
      largest models are Translated in no more than a few seconds. Any errors
      that are detected are placed in a circular error message queue so that
      they may be corrected quickly using the full screen editor in the Text
      View of the Model Object. Error correction is aided by automatic placement
      of the cursor next to the offending lexical element in the model. The
      error list is easily traversed by mouse or keystroke, and is saved with
      the Model Object.

      GPSS Block Menu Window. You can then open a Creation Dialog for any GPSS
      Block by clicking on the appropriate button. When you click the OK button
      after filling in the information needed by the Block, the resulting
      statement is checked for syntax errors and, if correct, is inserted into
      the Model just after the line containing the flashing insertion point.

      either screening or optimizing experiments automatically. Optionally, a
      CONDUCT Command will be loaded into a function key so that all you must do
      to run the experiment is to Create the Simulation Object and press the

      Compatibility</font></h2>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      The following section is an extensive comparison
      between GPSS World, and its predecessor, GPSS/PC. You should skip this
      section if you have no experience with GPSS/PC.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      GPSS World is compatible with GPSS/PC, and normally
      yields results that are statistically indistinguishable from it. This
      level of compatibility is available by simply correcting a few
      differences, and running the simulations.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      In addition, a higher level of compatibility is
      available called GPSS/PC Compatibility Mode. In most cases, you can
      achieve precise duplication of results. However, GPSS World utilizes a new
      run time library. Its floating point round off differs slightly from that
      used in GPSS/PC. Even so, most GPSS/PC models can be modified slightly to
      achieve identical results when run under the Commercial Version of GPSS
      World in GPSS/PC Compatibility Mode. The procedure you should follow is
      detailed below, after the discussion of differences between GPSS World and
      GPSS/PC.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>

      1.5.1. Differences from GPSS/PC</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      GPSS World has many differences from GPSS/PC. GPSS
      World is based on the idea that a textual Model Object is built, and/or
      modified, and then Translated in order to create a Simulation Object. This
      differs from the GPSS/PC notions of Program File and Simulation.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      In GPSS World, the model loading operation of GPSS/PC
      has been completely replaced. Instead of scanning each line, one at a
      time, GPSS World has a full-screen editor and a Create Simulation menu
      Command. Any errors detected during the Translation are saved in an error
      message queue, so they may be easily found and corrected. The speed of the
      Translator assures that the detection/correction of errors can proceed
      quickly.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      GPSS World does not perform Keystroke Error Prevention,
      as did GPSS/PC. Instead, GPSS World uses the model Translator for creating
      the simulation. This improves the model load-time by a factor of hundreds.
      However, it changes the error detection mechanism. Now, errors are
      detected during Translation, and are corrected by Selecting &quot;Next
      Error&quot; from the Search submenu of the Main Window. The cursor then
      automatically moves to the error, and an error message is written in the
      status line at the bottom of the Main Window.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Perhaps the next most noticeable change from GPSS/PC is
      that line numbers are no longer necessary, and in fact, they are ignored
      by GPSS World. This means that the positioning of Blocks is no longer
      specified by the line number of the Block, only by its relative position
      in the Model File(s) given to the Translator. Since the new INCLUDE
      Statement allows Model Objects to contain other plain text files, it is
      the sequence of Block Statements read by the Translator that dictates the
      position of Blocks in the simulation. Although Blocks can no longer be
      inserted during a simulation, it turns out that the Translation time is so
      fast, for most purposes it will be as easy to retranslate the model when a
      change to the Block structure is desired. Even so, the high level of
      interactivity of &quot;Manual Simulation&quot; is retained. This means
      that any Model Statement can be used during a simulation as an Interactive
      Command.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      The level of interactivity of GPSS World has been
      maintained. Any Model Statement can be passed to an existing simulation
      for execution. In fact, PLUS Procedures can be defined, or even redefined,
      on the fly. In the case of GPSS Commands, this usually redefines an
      entity, or controls the running of the simulation. In the case of a Block
      Statement, as in GPSS/PC, a &quot;Manual Simulation&quot; Block entry is
      attempted by the Active Transaction. All this is done using the Commands
      submenu, after the model has been Translated.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Automatic truncations have been removed from GPSS
      World. You must now explicitly use the INT( ) procedure, of some other
      method, if you wish intermediate numeric results to be truncated. This is
      true in all Expressions, even in VARIABLE and BVARIABLE Statements.
      Similarly, the data type returned by a System Numeric Attribute can now be
      either integer, real, or string, depending on the SNA. Even those SNAs
      returning parts per thousand do so as a real number of double precision
      between 0 and 1000, inclusively. The old truncations and integer SNAs can
      be enforced by running in GPSS/PC Compatibility Mode.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      The multitasking architecture of GPSS World has led to
      other changes. To begin with, messages are now sent to represent Commands
      or status changes. Therefore, online window update is done via a queue of
      messages received from the simulation. Similarly, most Commands received
      by the Simulation Object are placed on the simulation’s Command Queue
      before being executed one after the other. There are two exceptions: HALT
      and SHOW, which are done immediately when received. In addition, HALT
      deletes all remaining Commands on the queue.
      </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      The remaining changes will be listed here and discussed
      more fully, elsewhere in this manual.

      of changes you should make to your GPSS/PC Program Files. This will
      provide you with results that are not significantly different from those
      obtained form GPSS/PC simulations. You do not need GPSS/PC Compatibility
      Mode to achieve this level of correspondence.
        </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      However, if you want to obtain precise duplication of
      results, you must perform the procedure in the next section, as well.
        </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      There are many features provided to ensure an easy move
      to the new system. All GPSS/PC users should note the small number of
      enhancements that may require changes to your existing Model Files. The
      other end of the spectrum is those users who wish to precisely duplicate
      the GPSS/PC results in order to establish the veracity of the model when
      running under GPSS World. After that, it’s an easy matter to switch over
      to the new mode of operation, including the floating point clock, and the
      myriad of other features.

      Line numbers are now ignored. Do not use old Program
      Files that replaced GPSS/PC Blocks by line number. If you use them as
      Include-files they will add to the size of the simulation, if you use them
      as interactive Commands they will be executed one at a time as Manual
      Simulation Statements.

      It is probably safest to remove all the old run
      commands from the old GPSS/PC Program File until you have tested your
      modified model. Do not use line number replacement of Blocks in the
      Savable Program. This no longer works.

      1.5.3. Strict Duplication of Results</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      Most GPSS/PC Program Files can be made to yield
      precisely the same results when run under GPSS World. However, because of
      differences in the rounding of real numbers in floating point
      calculations, you may need to make a few additional modifications to the
      GPSS/PC Program File, in addition to the ones in the previous section. If
      you only need results that will be statistically indistinguishable from
      those obtained from GPSS/PC, you do not need to do the following things
      using the Commercial Version of GPSS World.
        </font></p>
           <p align="left"><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">
      1.&nbsp;This first step is to turn on GPSS/PC Compatibility Mode in
          the Model Settings. This causes GPSS World to use an integer clock and
          to truncate results, just as GPSS/PC did.

          by 4 points, do not allow any probability to be .25. You can do this
          by adding additional points until 1/n is a repeating fraction, or is
          not associated with any of the Function Follower Pairs. FN$SNORM and
          FN$XPDIS do not have to be changed.
