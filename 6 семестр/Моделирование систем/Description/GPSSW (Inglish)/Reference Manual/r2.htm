  <p ALIGN="left">This chapter contains a discussion of the organization of
  the features available in GPSS World and how to operate them. We first go
  through the installation procedure and then discuss the normal operation of an
  installed GPSS World package. Specific windows are discussed only briefly. An
  additional treatment of each window type can be found in Chapter 5.
  Explanations of error messages are in Chapter 14.</p>

  Installation</font></h2>
  <b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5">
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">Normal installation of GPSS World places a copy of the
  executable files, the help file, and the GPSS Sample Models into folders,
  sometimes called directories, on your computer. Online HTML Documentation,
  such as this Reference Manual and the <i>GPSS World Tutorial Manual</i> are
  normally included in the installation of the Commercial Version of GPSS World.
  For Student Version installations the HTML manuals must be downloaded and/or
  copied separately. Both manuals are available in hardcopy form. All
  installations include the Reference Manual in the form of online help.</p>

  2.1.1. Overview</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p class="Standard">Your installation will begin when you double click on the 
	Microsoft Windows Installer (msi)&nbsp; file downloaded from MinutemanSoftware.com or 
	when you insert, or run the startup program on, an authentic GPSS World 
	Commercial Version Distribution CD. Unfortunately, we are not able to 
	support software obtained in any other way.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">There are two important issues to be dealt with right at
  the beginning. First, you should ensure that if your existing Model Objects
  have become obsolete that they will be preserved, i.e. usable, after the
  installation. Second, you should then uninstall any existing installation of
  the same GPSS World product.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
  </font>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  2.1.2. Preserving Obsolete Objects</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">If you are replacing an existing GPSS World installation,
  you should first determine if your old Model Objects will have to be updated.
  Although we try not to impose this inconvenience on you, occasionally the
  internal format of Model Objects must be changed. Before you begin the
  installation, download the current notices or view the general information
  page on the MinutemanSoftware.com Internet Web site to determine
  compatibility. If the Model Objects of the new version you are installing are
  incompatible with your existing Model Objects, you need to save your the text
  of each existing Model Object before you continue with the installation. To do
  so, open each of your Model Objects and use the Windows clipboard to save the
  text in each Model Object (.gps file) into a newly created Text Object. Then,
  after the installation, you can again use the clipboard to move the Model
  Statements into newly created Model Objects of the new kind. You do not have
  to update existing Text Objects. If you are not using the default Model
  Settings, you will also need to modify the Settings in each new Model Object.
  For that purpose, you may want to record all the old Settings before the
  installation. Settings can be viewed or changed using the <b>Edit / Settings</b>
  menu item in the Main Window.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Usually, the new Model Objects will be compatible with the
  old so that you won't have to do all this.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Although the internal format of Model Objects usually does
  not change from one release of GPSS World to the next, this is not true for
  Simulation Objects. Usually, but not always, you will have to retranslate your
  Models using the new version of GPSS World, thereby creating new Simulation
  Objects. As long as your old Model Objects are compatible with the new ones,
  this is a simple matter. The only thing to worry about is that if you have
  made changes to the Settings of the old Simulation Objects. If so, you will
  have to change those same Settings in the new Simulation Object using the <b>Edit
  / Settings</b> menu command. You may want to record the old values before
  proceeding.</p>

  2.1.3. Uninstalling the old GPSS World</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">Before beginning the installation, we recommend that you
  remove any existing old installation of the same GPSS World Product. (The
  Student and Commercial Versions are different products). This will not remove
  your own Objects, only the ones that were installed originally with GPSS
  World. The Uninstall operation is done though the Add / Remove folder in the
  Control Panel of your operating system. Usually, your old Commercial Version
  software key will be preserved if you install into the same directory. You can
  install the Student Version of GPSS World even if you already have the
  Commercial Version installed, and vice versa.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">After any old installation has been removed, you are ready
  to install GPSS World. If you are installing from a CD into a system with the
  autorun capability enabled, simply inserting the CD will start the Setup
  program. Otherwise, open the CD icon in your My Computer folder and double
  click on the Setup icon.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">It's even easier if you are installing from a World.exe or
  Student.exe self-extracting file downloaded from MinutemanSoftware.com. Just
  double click on its icon and the GPSS World setup program will begin.</p>

  2.1.4. Installation Requirements</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">First, you should check that the installation requirements
  have been met.</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
  <p align="left">Configuration Requirements</p>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">1.&nbsp;The use of the GPSS World Package requires an IBM
  compatible computer running Windows 98 or a compatible operating system.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">2.&nbsp;We recommend an Intel Pentium III CPU, or better.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">3.&nbsp;Floating point math coprocessor capabilities are
  strongly recommended, but not required. Most CPU chips marketed today have
  floating point processors.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">4.&nbsp;A mouse is strongly recommended. Although
  simulations can be built and run without a mouse, some optional operations
  require the use of one.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">5.&nbsp;At least 32 megabytes of random access memory (RAM)
  is recommended.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">6.&nbsp;At least 15 megabytes of hard disk space is
  required for installation of all components of the Commercial Version. More is
  recommended for holding Model Files. In addition, adequate swap space must be
  available to the Windows Virtual Memory Manager.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">7.&nbsp;CD drive is required only if installation is from
  CD medium.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">8.&nbsp;A
  16 digit numeric user key is required for the operation of the software. This numeric
  key must be obtained from MinutemanSoftware.com after the basic installation
  process has completed.</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
  <p align="left">Version Restrictions</p>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p class="Standard" style="margin-bottom:12.05pt;text-indent:0in">1. The 
	Student Version of GPSS World is limited to simulations containing no more 
	than 180 GPSS Block Entities, and the Personal Version is limited to 2000. 
	The Commercial Version can run simulations of millions of blocks since it is 
	limited only by the size of the virtual memory provided by your operating 
	system. For optimal performance you should have enough RAM on your personal 
	computer so that all simulations to be run at one time can fit in it.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black">2. The 
	Student Version cannot open simulations saved by the Personal or the 
	Commercial Version of GPSS World. The Commercial Version can open any 
	simulation of the same version number, as well as those with other 
	compatible version numbers.</span></p>

  2.1.5. File Folders/Directories</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">Although you can choose otherwise, the GPSS World setup
  program normally installs the software in the Minuteman Software folder in
  your computer's Program Files folder. In the following discussion we will use
  &quot;folder&quot; and &quot;directory&quot; synonymously. The Commercial
  Version of GPSS World will be placed in a folder named Commercial GPSS World
  in the Minuteman Software folder. The Samples folder, which holds all the
  examples, is then placed in that. Files pertaining to the operation of GPSS
  World are normally placed in the &quot;module directory&quot;, i.e. the one
  containing the GPSS World executable files. Other sharable executables may be
  placed in one of your computer's system directories if they are not already
  present.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The operation of GPSS World results in the creation of
  several different files on your computer. Files for notices, registration
  information, and user keys are created in the module directory. You Control
  the other file placements when you open and save GPSS World Objects. Just as
  with GPSS World Objects, Data Streams can be directed to specific directories
  by your GPSS Open Statement. If you specify only a filename and not a path,
  the directory containing your Simulation Object is used.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Unless you direct otherwise in the <b>File / Save As</b>
  menu item, Simulation Objects will be placed with their parent Model Objects,
  and Report Objects will be placed with their parent Simulation Objects.
  Similarly, the search for Include-files begins in the Model Object's folder,
  or for Data Stream Text Objects in the Simulation Object's folder.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World can now invoke external programs directly by
  dynamic <b>Call()</b> Procedures. The rules for the location of the executable
  files containing the target functions are detailed in Chapter 8.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When you begin to build your own models you should create
  directories which make sense with respect to the project you are working on.
  For example, if you are investigating two very different inventory control
  strategies that need two very different models to simulate them, you may find
  advantages in placing them in separate directories. On the other hand,
  variants on a theme may best be organized in subfolders with the same parent.</p>

  Procedure</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p class="Standard">The use of all GPSS World products is governed by a 
	license agreement which can be displayed during installation or by selecting

	installed it. If you choose to use the Online Activation method, the 
	activation process is almost automatic.</font></p>
	<p class="Standard"><font size="2">You may activate your GPSS World

    2.2.1. The Main Window</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
	<p ALIGN="left">The GPSS World simulation environment is the collection
    of all the actions available to you when you open a Session. Everything is
    controlled from the GPSS World Main Window, an example of which is shown
    next.</p>
	<p ALIGN="center">
	<img border="0" src="../images/R2_13.gif" width="481" height="338"></p>

	<p ALIGN="center"><i><font FACE="Times" SIZE="2">Figure 2_13. The
    GPSS World Main Window</p></font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
	<p ALIGN="left">The Main Window has several components. The Title Bar is
    at the very top. Below that is the Menu, and below that the Toolbar (which
    can be hidden by toggling the <b>View / Toolbar</b> menu command). Most of
    the action occurs in the large empty client area.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">At the very bottom of the Main Window is a Status Line
    that is divided into three parts. The left pane of the Status Line shows
    Command Prompts that give you more information on the menu items you are
    about to use. The middle pane of the Status Line shows status and error
    messages send from the GPSS World Objects you are interacting with. Finally,
    there is a small pane at the right side of the Status Line that is used to
    display the changing System Clock of running simulations. You can turn this
    on or off for each Simulation Object by using the <b>View / Show Clock</b>
    menu command.</p>

    2.2.2. A Quick Overview</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
	<p ALIGN="left">Using the menu of the Main Window, you can create and
    manipulate the Objects of GPSS World: Model, Simulation, Report, and Text
    Objects. Each of these will have one or more views that can be opened within
    the GPSS World Main Window.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">A typical project begins with the creation and
    modification of a Model Object. A Model is just a list of Model Statements,
    defined in Chapters 6, 7, and 8. After the Model is composed the next step
    is to create a Simulation Object. Each time you select <b>Command / Create
    Simulation</b> or <b>Command / Retranslate</b> from the Main Window's Menu,
    GPSS World Translates the Model Statements into a runnable Simulation
    Object. If errors need to be corrected, a single keystroke (representing <b>Search
    / Next Error</b>) can cycle through the circular error list, setting the
    cursor in the Text View of the Model, just before each error.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">Once a Simulation Object is successfully Created, you can
    send any Model Statement to it to change the structure or state of the
    simulation. Normally, you will send Commands, such as START, but you can
    redefine entities or PLUS Procedures, as well.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">You can send Model Statements to existing Simulation
    Objects using one of several methods.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">First, some of the most common commands are listed in the
    <b>Command</b> menu of the Main Window. Most have keyboard accelerators as
    well.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">Second, the Custom Command dialog is invoked through <b>Command
    / Custom</b> in the Main Window's menu. Here you can type any Model
    Statement -- even a PLUS Procedure -- and send it to an existing Simulation
    Object.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">Third, you can load the set of function keys with you own
    choice of Commands. This is done through the Edit / Settings menu item in
    the Main Window. Thereafter, pressing the function key sends the Command to
    the currently selected Simulation Object.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">Complex PLUS Procedures and lengthy Command lists can be
    sent using an INCLUDE Statement associated with a previously created Text
    Object. You can enter INCLUDE as a custom command ( <b>Command / Custom</b>
    ) or load it into a function key. After an INCLUDE Statement is loaded into
    a function key ( <b>Edit / Settings</b> ), a single keystroke sends the
    whole lot to the Simulation Object for processing.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">During the debugging phase of your project, be sure to
    make use of all the visualization tools at your disposal. There are 10
    dynamic windows and 7 snapshot windows that let you view the running
    simulation. Most require no effort on your part except to open them. Some,
    like the Blocks Window, add point and click debugging facilities for
    manipulating stop conditions and for controlling the advance of the
    simulation during debugging.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">A new PLUS Trace feature can be turned on in the Settings
    Notebook. It will place a description of each PLUS Procedure invocation in
    your Journal Window. Here's a useful tip: If you define a PLUS Procedure
    that takes arguments but does nothing, you can place invocations of it
    anywhere in your PLUS code to evaluate and trace your own User Variables --
    both Global and Temporary.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">Among the dynamic windows are the Plot and Expression
    Windows which allow you to visualize the evaluation of any PLUS expression
    as it changes dynamically. The Tables Window can also be very enlightening,
    visualizing the convergence of frequency distributions. In addition, there
    are seven snapshot windows that present detailed state information at some
    instant within the simulation.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">GPSS World is strong in the extensiveness of its Standard
    Reports. Unless you choose otherwise, when a Simulation Object completes a
    simulation (i.e. the Termination Count reaches zero), it creates a Report
    Object containing a Standard Report describing the final state of the
    simulation. You can modify the content of Standard Reports by editing the
    Settings of the Simulation Object. Interim reports can often be used
    effectively during the debugging/testing process. While interacting with a
    Simulation Object you can use the REPORT Command to create a Report Object
    describing all internal GPSS Entities.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">You can extract just about any information you desire
    from a simulation by using Data Streams. These are associated with a set of
    GPSS Blocks and PLUS library procedures (OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE, SEEK)
    that allow you to trace and collect derived information from the simulation
    and write them to plain text files. Such traces can be used to drive
    photo-realistic animations, as well. Within GPSS World, text files used in
    association with Data Streams are represented as Text Objects. The new Call
    PLUS procedures provide direct online access to external programs such as
    ad-hoc animators.</p>
	<p ALIGN="left">After the Model is thoroughly tested, it is time to
    define an Experiment to quantify results and test their statistical
    significance. GPSS World excels in this regard. Its built-in programming
    language, PLUS, supports a special kind of PROCEDURE statement, called,
    naturally, the EXPERIMENT Statement. Within an experiment, you can run and
    analyze complex experiments unattended. You can even get an automatic
    Analysis of Variance of the results. These features are developed in the
    OneWay.gps Sample Model, and further in Lessons 19 and 20 of the <i>GPSS
    World Tutorial Manual</i>. Chapter 13 of this manual discusses ANOVA and the
    Automatic Experiment Generators in depth.</p></font><b>

    </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
    <p align="left">The File Menu</p>
    </blockquote>
    </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">The leftmost menu is the File Menu. It is used to open
    and save Objects, print views of Objects, access the Internet to download
    notices and Internet Web pages, and to register the software for users of
    the Commercial Version.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
    <p align="left">The Edit Menu</p>
    </blockquote>
    </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">The top items in the Edit Menu are for working with text.
    All GPSS World Objects have a Text View that can be modified using these
    menu commands. <b>Undo</b> is a &quot;one-level backup&quot; facility for
    removing the effects of the last Text View interaction. <b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b>
    and <b>Paste</b> move selections to and from the Windows clipboard. <b>Insert
    Line</b> and <b>Delete Line</b> operate at the cursor location in a Text
    View. The <b>Font</b> command opens a dialog allowing customization of the
    view.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The remaining five items allow you to modify attributes
    of GPSS World Objects. <b>Expression Window</b> and <b>Plot Window</b> open
    a dialog which allow you to change the contents of an existing dynamic
    Expression Window or Plot Window. <b>Insert Block</b> opens the <b>Block
    Input Menu</b> from which you can open a <b>Block Creation Dialog</b>. These
    Dialogs are available for guiding the creation of GPSS Blocks. When you
    complete a Block Creation Dialog and click OK, the new Block Statement is
    inserted after the Insertion Point in the Model. Block Statements created
    this way contain tabs. You can adjust tabstops in the Report page of the
    Model Object's Settings. <b>Insert Experiment</b> opens a dialog which
    allows you to automatically generate either an efficient screening
    experiment or a sophisticated optimizing experiment and insert it into a
    Model Object. See Chapter 13 of this manual for a discussion of the
    Automatic Experiment Generators.</p>
    <b>
    <p ALIGN="left">Edit / Settings</b> allows you to view and modify the
    Settings of a Model, Simulation, or Report Object. These attributes are
    discussed in detail below.</p>

    <blockquote>
    </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
    <p align="left">The Search Menu</p>
    </blockquote>
    </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">The Search Menu helps you navigate inside the text view
    of an object.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The first item,<b> Find / Replace</b>, opens a dialog
    that lets you move to the next occurrence of specific text, and optionally
    replace it. A Replace All option is available, as well.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The <b>Go To Line</b> item will jump to a line number in
    the text. This is useful at times when an error message from a simulation
    mentions a line number.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The next set of items is for Bookmarks. They let you
    place invisible marks that get saved with the object. They form a circular
    list that you can traverse via the appropriate menu commands or keystrokes.
    The <b>Next Bookmark</b> menu command jumps to that position in the text
    corresponding to the next Bookmark in the list. <b>Mark</b> enters a
    Bookmark at the current cursor position. <b>Unmark</b> removes the current
    Bookmark. <b>Unmark All</b> removes all Bookmarks, <b>Select to Bookmark</b>
    selects text from the current cursor position to the current Bookmark
    position.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The last two items in the Search menu deal with
    Translation error messages. When you try to Create a Simulation Object from
    a Model which contains syntax errors, a circular list of error messages and
    locations is built into the Model Object, replacing any that was there
    before. This list becomes part of the Model Object and is saved with it. To
    traverse the list in either direction use the <b>Next Error</b> and <b>Previous
    Error</b> menu commands to display the error message in the Status Line at
    the bottom of the Main Window. At the same time the cursor is placed just
    before the error in the Text View so you can correct it. The keyboard
    accelerators </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[N]</b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    and <b>[Ctrl]+[Altl]+[P]</b></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> let you navigate the list easily from
    the keyboard.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
    <p align="left">The View Menu</p>
    </blockquote>
    </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">The View menu includes menu commands for controlling what
    is shown in a few of the windows.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The first item, <b>Notices</b>, allows you to view the
    notices concerning GPSS World. You can update them from
    minutemansoftware.com if you need to.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">With the second item, <b>Toolbar</b>, you can hide or
    show the Main Window's Toolbar by toggling the first item Toolbar.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The third item, <b>Entity Details</b>, lets you change
    the format of some of the dynamic simulation windows to show more or less
    detail onscreen.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The last menu item, <b>Clock</b>, toggles a switch in the
    current Simulation Object. If this switch is on in the current Simulation
    Object, changes in the System Clock of the simulation are displayed in the
    lower right of the Status Line of the Main Window when one of that
    Simulation Object's views is the active window. This is a handy way to
    assure yourself that a simulation is indeed running, but it slows down the
    simulation somewhat.</p>
    <blockquote>
    </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
    <p align="left">The Command Menu</p>
    </blockquote>
    </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">The Command Menu is concerned with creating and
    manipulating Simulation Objects. The <b>Create Simulation</b> menu command
    invokes the high performance Translator to create a Simulation Object based
    on the Model Statements in an existing Model Object and its Include-files.
    Normally you will encounter errors that must be corrected (see <b>Search /
    Next Error</b>, above). The <b>Retranslate</b> menu command is available to
    perform the Translation again when errors have been corrected.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Next, <b>Repeat Last Command</b> is an easy way to do
    some action again on behalf of the same Object.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The remaining menu commands represent formal GPSS
    Commands. Most have accelerator keys for easy use and most can be loaded
    into a function key, as well. These menu commands are disabled unless the
    current Simulation Object is ready for them.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">You can click on the last item in the Command submenu, <b>Custom</b>,
    in order to write your own Model Statement, not listed elsewhere.</p>

    </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">The top two items in the Window Menu can be used to tidy
    up when many windows are open in the Client Area of the Main Window. <b>Tile</b>
    will cover the client are of the Main Window with a small version of all
    open windows and <b>Cascade </b>will stack them in a handy stack where all
    title bars can be seen.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The next two items have submenus themselves. They are
    used to open Windows and Snapshots on existing Simulation Objects. These
    individual windows are discussed below. They are disabled until the current
    Simulation Object is ready to oblige.</p>

    2.2.3. Settings</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">Settings are collections of values that form a common
    thread throughout most of the GPSS World Objects. They are used to control
    the simulation, the appearance of reports, and the contents of windows and
    loadable function keys.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Settings are inherited. When you Create a Simulation
    Object, it inherits its initial Settings from its parent Model Object. So if
    you want to set values for all the simulations in your project, you should
    set them in the Model Object.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Similarly, Report Objects inherit their settings from the
    Simulation Object that created them. In this way, the Report contains a
    read-only record of the Settings in effect when the simulation was run.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Text Objects are different. They are mere representations
    of plain text files and do not contain a copy of Settings. This is the
    reason that they are the only GPSS World Objects that can be opened by
    external text editors. The other objects contain Settings, Bookmarks, and in
    the case of Model Objects, Result Lists, that are saved with the object and
    that confound external word processors. If you need to, you can always
    transfer just the text to and from the text view of these GPSS World Objects
    using the Windows clipboard.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">To open a Settings Notebook you must first select an open
    GPSS World Object. Then, its Settings are viewed or modified by selecting <b>Edit / Settings</b></font>
    <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    after clicking on the GPSS World Object to be changed.
    This presents the Settings Notebook for that Object, with 5 tabbed pages.</p>

    The Simulation Page of the Settings Notebook</p>
    </font></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">The Simulation Page contains several values that you can
    change which affect the limits and behavior of running simulation.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The <b>Poll Count</b> Setting is the number of Block
    entries to be attempted before checking for any kind of interruption, such
    as a Command from the user.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">If you use a lot of GPSS Transaction Parameters in your
    model, you can speed up simulations a little by putting them into a
    Parameter Block. To do this enter the number of Parameters to be blocked
    into the <b>Parameter Block Size</b> field, and the Parameter number of the
    first Parameter in the block in the <b>Parameter Block First </b>field. If
    you are using Names instead of numbers to refer to these Parameters, you
    should control the values given to Parameter Names by using EQU Statements.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The <b>Max Evaluation Depth</b> is used to protect
    against circular references in sets of PLUS Procedures. If your simulation
    is highly nested without circular references, you can increase this value to
    accommodate any level of nested Procedure calls.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The <b>Stack Size</b> is used to allocate stack space for
    nested PLUS Procedures and library procedures. You can save space by
    decreasing this value, but if you get a Stack Overflow Error Stop during a
    simulation, you may have to increase it.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The <b>Integration Tolerance</b> field is used by the
    continuous simulation phase. If you loosen this tolerance by making it
    larger, your integrations will be faster but may lose some accuracy.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The<b> Max Memory Request</b> places a limit on the
    acquisition of RAM memory for structures such as tables and matrices. Such a
    limit is useful to catch errors, but you can increase it as necessary. If
    your RAM memory demands exceed that available in your computer, your
    operating system's virtual memory manager will have to increase its disk
    activity and perhaps its disk swap space usage significantly.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The four checkboxes at the bottom of the page control
    GPSS/PC Compatibility, which is available only in the Commercial Version,
    and how Data Stream errors are to be handled in the simulation.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">CHECK the </font><b>GPSS/PC Compatibility</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    checkbox to operate the simulation in GPSS/PC Compatibility mode as

    <p ALIGN="left">The <b>Saved Plot Points</b> value tells GPSS World how
    much space to allocate to a circular buffer for recent Plot points. If you
    scroll or print a Plot Window, these values are used to rebuild the plot. If
    you don't have enough, the leftmost segment of the scrolled or printed plot

    <p ALIGN="left">To keep naming of objects unique, GPSS World adds a
    sequence number to the names of newly created child objects. The number to
    be used for the next sequence number is kept here, in the Settings of the
    parent object. To change it just modify the <b>Child Object Sequence Numbe</b>r
    field.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The Random Number Streams groupbox contains the remaining
    settings on the page. They determine which GPSS Random Number Stream is to
    be used for the purpose of resolving Time Ties, time randomization in
    GENERATE and ADVANCE Blocks, and Next Block in TRANSFER Blocks.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The </font><b>Time Ties</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    entry field allows you to specify that when imminent events occur at the

  <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">The physical process of model development starts with the
  creation of a Model Object that contains Model Statements written by you.
  Model Statements are defined in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of this manual. Often
  it's easiest to begin building a simulation by modifying an existing model.
  The Samples folder is rich source of small GPSS World Model Objects.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Model Statements can exist in additional Text Objects
  (.txt) as well as the primary Model Object (.gps), permitting you to share
  code across projects. Although there's only one Model Object in a simulation,
  there can be many Text Objects. These are connected to the Model Object with
  INCLUDE Statements, which take the name of the Text Object file (.txt) as an
  argument.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Model development begins by opening a Text View of the
  Model Object. A complete set of text editing operations is available for
  modifying and adding Model Statements. If you prefer, the use of the Block
  Input Menu and one or more Block Creation Dialogs makes it relatively easy to
  correctly specify the Blocks Statements in your Model. Each Block Statement is
  inserted in a line following that of the flashing insertion point in the Model
  Object. Online Help guides you all the way and syntax errors are prevented.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A model must be Translated in order to Create a Simulation
  Object. The Translation is started via the <b>Command / Create Simulation </b>item
  in the main menu of the Model Window. The Translator determines if there are
  syntax errors in the model. If so, a circular queue of error messages is
  created so that the errors can be found and corrected easily. If no errors are
  found, the resulting simulation automatically sent to the Simulation Object,
  replacing any that already existed. When the Simulation Object receives a
  simulation, it immediately performs all embedded Commands in the order
  encountered by the Translator.</p>
  <blockquote>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
  <p align="left">INCLUDE Commands</p>
  </blockquote>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">You can use an INCLUDE Command anywhere in a Model except
  in a PLUS Procedure. Normally, they are used in Model Objects to incorporate
  statements from one or more Text Objects. INCLUDE Statements can be nested to
  a depth of 5, but they cannot be used inside a PLUS Procedure.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The syntax of the INCLUDE Command is:</p>
    </font>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font size="3"><b><font FACE="Arial">
  INCLUDE </font></b></font><i><font size="3"><b>&quot;FileSpec&quot;</b></font></p>
  </i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">Where you replace the italicized word <i>FileSpec </i>with
  your file specification, including extension (normally .txt), and enclose it
  in double quotes. The default directory is that of the Model Object.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">INCLUDE Commands have other uses, as well. You can type an
  INCLUDE Command as a Custom Interactive Command. This causes a whole file of
  Model Statements to be Translated and sent to the Simulation Object. An
  INCLUDE Command can be loaded into a function key, just like any other GPSS
  Command. In this manner a single keystroke can initiate a complex Command File
  or PLUS Procedure redefinition.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Before you use a file in an INCLUDE Command, you should
  Translate it by itself to remove syntax errors. To do so, copy its Model
  Statements to the clipboard, open a new temporary Model Object, paste into it
  from the clipboard, and Translate it using <b>Command / Create Simulation</b>.
  This allows you to correct any Syntax Errors easily before combining the Text
  Object into a more complicated model.</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
  <p align="left">Translating Models</p>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">Simulation Objects begin as Translated Model Objects. When
  you Translate a model by selecting<b> </b></font><b><font FACE="Arial">Command
  / Create Simulation</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">, the GPSS World
  Translator checks for syntax errors, creates a simulation, and sends it to a
  newly created Simulation Object. If successful, </font><font FACE="Helv" SIZE="2">Translation
  activates all the Interactive Commands and Simulation Windows, so that the
  state of the newly created simulation can be monitored and controlled. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">After
  that, you can send any Model Statement to the existing simulation for
  processing.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Helv" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">GPSS World features a new high performance Model Translator
  that is hundreds of times faster than its predecessor. The largest models are
  Translated in no more than a few seconds. </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">When
  the Translator detects one or more errors in the model, it creates a circular
  list of error messages that can be accessed from the Text View of the Model
  Object. You can traverse the error list quickly using the </font><b>Search /
  Next Error</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"> or </font><b>Search / Previous
  Error </b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">menu commands. Both have keyboard
  mnemonics and accelerators. Each stop in the list places the error message in
  the Status Line of the Main Window and places the insertion point in the Model
  Text View just before the syntactical element that caused the error. It's then
  a simple matter to correct each error and move to the next.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">If an error occurs in an INCLUDEd Text Object, and you
  cannot find it easily, you can paste those statements into a new temporary
  Model Object and Translate it by itself. It is best to place only tested
  statements into an Include-file.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Blocks are placed in the simulation in the same order that
  they are encountered by the Translator. Commands are accumulated in an ordered
  list that is sent to the Simulation Object with the simulation. The list is
  scanned for Immediate Commands (SHOW, HALT, and CONDUCT), and the remainder
  are placed on the simulation’s Command Queue and executed one after the
  other. Command Lists sent interactively to an existing simulation are treated
  the same way.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Dynamic simulation windows (not Snapshots) are
  automatically refreshed when you Translate a model to ensure that the view is
  current. If an entity can no longer be found, say, in a Table Window, the
  Window will be closed automatically.</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
  <p align="left">Controlling Simulations</p>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">GPSS Commands are used to control the running of
  simulations. They are discussed in detail in Chapter 6. They may be embedded
  in a model or they may be sent as Interactive Statements.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Any Model Statement may be sent to an existing simulation.
  Such statements are called Interactive Statements. You can control and view
  running simulations very closely with the operations that are available. To do
  so, use the <b>Command </b>menu in the Main Window. If the Command you need is
  not listed, select </font><b>Command / Custom</b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  and type it into the entry field, and select </font><b><font FACE="Arial">OK</font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">.
  This action Translates the Command and sends it to the simulation. The Command
  menu is disabled until there is a simulation to receive interactions.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">You may use GPSS Block Statements and PLUS Procedure
  definitions as Interactive Commands. Block Statements sent interactively to an
  existing simulation cause a temporary Block to be created and immediately
  destroyed after the Active Transaction attempts to enter it. This mode is
  called <i>Manual Simulation</i>. Procedure Statements sent to an existing
  Simulation Object register a user created PLUS Procedure, replacing any of
  that same name that may already exist.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Interactions are logged in the Journal View of the
  Simulation Object.</p>
  <blockquote>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial">
  <p align="left">Running</p>
  </blockquote>
  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">Normally, a START Command is used to begin a simulation. It
  could be entered interactively or could be part of the Model Object. The START
  Statement specifies the Termination Count, which is an important state
  variable of the simulation. The Termination Count must be decremented to zero
  for the simulation to end. Any TERMINATE Statement in the simulation can
  decrement this count.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When the Simulation Object executes a START Command,
  Transactions will begin to circulate in the simulation. Normally, the
  simulation will end by itself and will produce a Standard Report when the
  Termination Count reaches zero. If an error stop occurs, no report is written.
  Reporting options can be changed in the Settings of the Simulation Object.
  These are described above in Section 2.2.3.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Multiple simulations can be run unattended by using RESET,
  CLEAR, and START in a sequence of Commands. These are commonly used in PLUS
  Experiments, which can control and analyze extensive sets of simulation runs.
  PLUS Experiments are discussed in this manual in Section 8.2.4 , and in Lesson
  19 of <i>The GPSS World Tutorial Manual</i>.</p>

      <p align="left">Stopping a Simulation</p>
      </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </u></b>
  <p ALIGN="left">You may stop a running simulation in several ways.</p>
  <blockquote>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;First, you can
  interrupt a simulation by sending a HALT Command. HALT can be asserted by the <b>[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[H]</b>
  Hot Key, a Function Key, an Interactive Command from the Command menu, or as
  part of a Command File.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;Second, you can
  enter one or more stop conditions with the STOP Command, before you START or
  CONTINUE the simulation. STOP commands set conditions which when detected will
  cause the simulation to halt. When the simulation stops, previous stop
  conditions are not removed. If you CONTINUE a simulation after a stop
  condition was found, the original condition that caused the simulation to stop
  is ignored to allow the stopped Transaction to proceed. STOP conditions can be
  controlled by &quot;Point and Shoot&quot; operations in the Debug Toolbar
  using only the mouse. This is discussed below, and in Chapter 5.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;Third, you can
  resume the simulation with a STEP Command. After the specified number of Block
  entry attempts, the simulation will stop automatically.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;Fourth, when an
  error condition is detected, an Error Stop occurs. The simulation is halted
  and messages are sent to identify the reason.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">&nbsp;Fifth, you can
  simply wait for the simulation to complete. This occurs when the Termination
  Count falls to or below 0.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">In each of these cases, when the simulation stops, the
  state of the simulation is reported to the Journal View of the Simulation
  Object.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <b><u>
      <p align="left">Interactive Statements</p>
      </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </u></b>
  <p ALIGN="left">Any Model Statement can be sent to an existing simulation.
  These are called Interactive Statements. They can be Commands, PLUS Procedure
  definitions, or even Block Statements.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Every simulation has a Command Queue associated with it.
  The Simulation Object performs each Command on the queue one after the other,
  until it is HALTed or until it runs out of things to do. Even Commands in the
  Model, other than HALT and SHOW, are placed on the Command queue before they
  are performed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Interactive Commands are either <i>Immediate</i> or <i>Queued</i>.
  Immediate Commands, such as HALT and SHOW, are performed as soon as the
  Simulation Object receives them. All other Commands are queued. They are
  placed at the end of a list of Commands which have not yet been completed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The HALT Command is a special case. Not only is it an
  immediate Command, but it also deletes any remaining Queued Commands still on
  the Command queue. After a HALT Command is performed, the Simulation Object
  has nothing more to do on behalf of that simulation, for the moment, since the
  Command Queue is then empty.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Commands are not the only statements that can be used
  interactively. When a PLUS Procedure Statement is sent interactively, it
  causes the procedure to be registered within the simulation. Thereafter, the
  procedure can be invoked from any PLUS Expression. If a Procedure with the
  same name already exists within the simulation, it is redefined.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A PLUS Experiment is a special kind of Procedure. PLUS
  Experiments are can be sent interactively, as well. If any like-named PLUS
  Procedure (or Experiment) is currently registered with the Simulation Object,
  it is replaced. Then the Experiment can be invoked using a CONDUCT Command,
  which is discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Interactive Block Statements are called Manual Simulation
  Statements. When received by the Simulation Object, they cause a temporary
  Block to be created, and the Active Transaction to attempt to enter it. Then
  the Block is destroyed. In this manner, GPSS Blocks can be used as though they
  were commands, providing for a fine level of control over the simulation. Data
  Stream file I/O is supported interactively, as well. Data Streams are
  discussed in Section 4.16.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">GENERATE Blocks are the only ones which cannot be used in
  Manual Simulation Mode. Instead, SPLIT Block Statements can be used to create
  Transactions interactively.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The are several ways to send a Model Statement to the
  simulation. You can use the Command submenu of the Main Window, you can use a
  &quot;Hot Key&quot;, and you can associate a GPSS Statement with a Function
  Key in the Model Settings Notebook.</p>

    interactively. You can use STORAGE, TABLE, QTABLE, MATRIX, or VARIABLE
    Commands using the same label to do so. Similarly, PLUS Procedures may be
    redefined interactively.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">A location label, or simply location, is a name used to
    label a Block Statement. This field is not required in a Block Statement.
    Unlike other entity types, Blocks may not be redefined in GPSS World. A
    similar flexibility can be achieved by using an EXECUTE Block and redefining
    its Operand A.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">A wide variety of windows are available for viewing

    <p ALIGN="left">Simulation windows are divided into two categories:
    Snapshots and Dynamic Windows. All Simulation Snapshots and Windows are

    Snapshots and Windows when the simulation is HALTed first.</p>

    </blockquote>
    </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">After you have created one or more GPSS models, you then
    normally enter a period of testing, tracing, and debugging your simulations.
    GPSS World provides you with many testing facilities, including visual aids,
    for use during the testing process. In addition, the high level of
    interactivity provided by GPSS World allows you to manipulate the
    simulations for the purpose of problem determination.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">First, you need to verify that the simulation is behaving
    as you expect. The GPSS World graphical windows are ideal for this purpose.
    We suggest that you start the simulation, and then begin to explore the
    overall behavior of your models as they converge to steady state behavior.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">One of the most useful windows for debugging is the
    Journal View of the Simulation Object. When you cause the Trace Indicator of
    a Transaction to be turned on, all Block entries of that Transaction cause a
    Trace Message to be displayed in the Journal View. You can place TRACE
    Blocks inside the model for this purpose, or you can use TRACE Statements in
    Manual Simulation Mode, to control the Trace Indicator of individual
    Transaction Entities. The PLUS Trace Setting can now be used to aid the
    development of PLUS Procedures. It is discussed below.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">For serious debugging you will probably need to place
    stops at certain places in the simulation, and then observe the state of the
    simulation by taking snapshots and opening dynamic windows. Snapshots of the
    CEC and FEC, in conjunction with the STEP Command, are often sufficient to
    determine why certain events occurred. The FEC and CEC can be visualized in
    snapshots or can be displayed using a REPORT Command.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Difficult debugging problems can often be best tackled by
    running a simulation to an important time, and then saving the Simulation
    Object. Stop conditions and memorized expressions are automatically saved
    with it. Then, by repeatedly reopening it as a new Simulation Object, you
    can rerun the simulation from the saved state.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">All SNAs are accessible using the SHOW Command. They can
    be visualized dynamically in an Expression Window of a Plot Window.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Sometimes it is useful to make corrections in the middle
    of a debugging run. GPSS World allows you to redefine entities, redefine
    PLUS Procedures, change the values of user defined names, and to manipulate
    the simulation by entering Manual Simulation Statements. You can then
    continue the simulation without a retranslating.</p>

    without the Place and Remove buttons. But they do have the rest. Use the
    Halt button to send a HALT Command to the Simulation Object. The Continue
    button resumes the simulation and the Step button causes the simulation to
    attempt to enter a single Block, and then HALT.</p>

    value of 0 is special. Since no Transaction or Block has a number of 0, this
    value is used to indicate &quot;Any&quot;. For example, the window above
    shows a single Stop Condition that occurs when any Transaction attempts to
    enter Block 3.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Stop Conditions are added to the list using the STOP

    recorded by trace messages written to the Simulation's Journal Window.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">You may find it useful to define a PLUS Procedure that
    takes one or more arguments but does nothing else. Then, you can insert
    invocations in your PLUS code that will cause traces of your User Variables
    to appear in the Journal Window. These can be easily removed after your PLUS
    Procedures are fully tested.</p>
