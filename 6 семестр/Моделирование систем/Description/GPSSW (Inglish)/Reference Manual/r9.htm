  Chains</h2>
  <p ALIGN="left">Transactions are temporarily bound to other entities by
  occupying linked lists called chains. Some entities, such as Facilities, have
  several chains. Other entities have just a single Retry Chain. Each
  Transaction may be on any number of chains. However, occupying one kind of
  chain sometimes precludes occupancy by the same Transaction on another. For
  example, a Transaction on one or more Interrupt Chains cannot be on the Future
  Events Chain.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A Transaction can be on no more than one of the following
  chains:</p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">A Transaction may be waiting for any number of conditions
  to occur, can be in any number of Transaction Groups, and may be preempted
  from any number of Facilities at any one time. This means that any single
  Transaction can be on any number of Interrupt Chains and any number of Group
  Chains and any number of Retry Chains at the same time.</p>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">Current Events Chain<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Current Events Chain (CEC) is a linked list of ready
  Transactions which have Blocks yet to be entered before simulated time
  advances. Although the CEC is kept in priority order, the Active Transaction
  is usually returned to the CEC ahead of its peers. For this reason, once a
  Transaction starts to move in the simulation, it tends to keep moving, unless
  a higher priority Transaction is reactivated.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When the Active Transaction comes to rest on some
  Transaction Chain, the highest priority Transaction remaining on the CEC
  becomes the Active Transaction. If the CEC is empty, the most imminent
  Transaction on the Future Events Chain is moved to the CEC.</p>
  </font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="5"></font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">Future Events Chain<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Future Events Chain (FEC) is a time-ordered chain which
  holds Transactions which must wait for a later simulated time. When all
  simulation activity for the current clock time is complete, the next
  Transaction is taken from the FEC. It is this action which causes the system
  clock to be updated. The value of the system clock is always equal to the
  scheduled time of the last Transaction to be taken from the FEC.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">ADVANCE Blocks and GENERATE Blocks are the only way to
  place a Transaction on the FEC. These blocks take a time increment as an
  operand and calculate the absolute time before placing the Transaction on the
  FEC. When the system clock reaches this absolute time, the Transaction is
  moved to the CEC so that it may resume its movement in the simulation. In this
  manner, a duration or inter arrival time can be simulated.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">PREEMPT Blocks, and the new DISPLACE Block, can be used to
  remove Transactions from the FEC. Such Transactions can be rescheduled by
  entering another ADVANCE Block.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When the scheduler must select a new Active Transaction, if
  it cannot find one on the CEC, it must take a Transaction from the FEC. This
  removal of one or more Transactions always causes the system clock to advance.
  When more than one Transaction resides on the FEC at the next imminent event
  time, a Time Tie is said to exist. If the Model Settings so dictate, when Time
  Tied Transactions are moved from the FEC to the CEC, their order is randomized
  within priorities. This is done to prevent unintentional processing cycles
  from developing.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A time tie is the occurrence of more than one Transaction
  with the same time value at the front of the FEC. When a time tie is detected,
  time tied Transactions are removed from the FEC in random order. For this
  purpose GPSS World draws pseudo random numbers from the random number
  generator specified in the Simulate page of the Model Settings Notebook. The
  removed Transactions are all placed in priority order on the Current Events
  Chain (CEC). The highest priority Transaction on the CEC then becomes the
  active Transaction. You can suppress the randomization of time ties by
  specifying 0 as the associated random number generator.</p>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">Retry Chains<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">Transactions which fail all tests required for Block entry
  are placed on a Retry Chain. These tests occur when a Transaction attempts to
  enter a GATE, TEST, TRANSFER ALL, or TRANSFER BOTH Block. Each entity has a
  chain of blocked Transactions, called a Retry Chain. Any Transaction on a
  Retry Chain is waiting for the value of an SNA to change. When the value of
  the SNA changes, any Transaction on the Retry Chain of the entity is
  reactivated. This results in replacement on the CEC. When the Transaction
  becomes the Active Transaction, the specific condition test is repeated. Since
  this process often uses computer time without advancing Transactions in the
  model, an injudicious choice of conditions can lead to an inefficient
  simulation. The power of GATE and TEST blocks must be exercised with caution.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Transactions on Retry Chains are replaced on the CEC by the
  process of reactivation. This is discussed below. If, on retry, any test is
  successful, the Transaction enters its next Block. When a Transaction enters a
  Block it is removed from all Retry Chains automatically.</p>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">Facility Chains<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">Each Facility Entity has four Transaction chains. They are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">PENDING

    <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">RETRY
    CHAIN - A list of Transactions which are waiting for the status of the
    Facility to change.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Pending Chain holds Transactions waiting to enter an
  Interrupt Mode PREEMPT Block. A Transaction which attempts to enter an
  Interrupt Mode PREEMPT Block on behalf of a Facility is refused entry to the
  PREEMPT Block if any preempted Transactions are on the Interrupt Chain of the
  Facility. A Transaction which is refused entry is placed on the Pending Chain
  of the Facility. This causes the Transaction to come to rest in the
  simulation. When a Transaction gives up ownership of the Facility, the first
  Transaction on the Pending Chain is given ownership and allowed to enter the
  PREEMPT Block.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Interrupt Chain is a list of preempted Transactions.
  When a Transaction enters a PREEMPT Block, and the Facility is currently owned
  by another Transaction, ownership is given to the new Transaction. The old
  Transaction is placed on the Interrupt Chain so that its ownership may be
  restored later. Transactions on one or more Interrupt Chains can still move in
  the simulation, however, their movement is restricted. Such a Transaction
  cannot exist on the FEC and cannot leave an ASSEMBLE, GATHER, or MATCH Block
  where it has been put in a Match Condition. When a Transaction gives up
  ownership of the Facility, if the Pending Chain is empty, the first
  Transaction on the Interrupt Chain is given ownership of the Facility.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Delay Chain holds Transactions waiting for ownership. A
  Transaction which attempts to enter a SEIZE Block on behalf of a Facility in
  use is refused entry to the SEIZE Block and is placed on the Delay Chain of
  the Facility in priority order. Similarly, a Transaction which attempts to
  enter a Priority Mode PREEMPT Block on behalf of a Facility in use (by a
  Transaction of equal or higher priority) is refused entry to the PREEMPT Block
  and is placed on the Delay Chain of the Facility in priority order. This
  causes the Transaction to come to rest in the active model and a new Active
  Transaction to be chosen. Then, when a Transaction gives up ownership of the
  Facility, if the Pending Chain and the Interrupt Chain are empty, the highest
  priority Transaction on the Delay Chain is given ownership of the Facility.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Retry Chain is a list of Transactions waiting for a
  Facility state change. These Transactions are reactivated when the Facility
  changes from one state to another.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Transactions waiting on a Delay Chain, a Pending Chain, or
  an Interrupt Chain, or owning a Facility are said to be &quot;in
  contention&quot; for the Facility. Since a contending Transaction will
  eventually become the owner of the Facility, contention for a Facility carries
  the obligation of releasing the Facility. If a Transaction which owns a
  Facility attempts to leave the simulation by entering a TERMINATE Block or an
  ASSEMBLE Block, an Error Stop occurs. However, a preempted Transaction is
  permitted to leave the simulation. Normally, each Transaction remains in
  contention until it voluntarily enters a RELEASE or RETURN Block on behalf of
  that Facility. However, PREEMPT and FUNAVAIL blocks have options which can
  remove other Transactions from contention for a Facility. This removes the
  obligation to return ownership as well. In fact, a non-contending Transaction
  which attempts to enter a RETURN or RELEASE Block will cause an Error Stop.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">To summarize, when a Facility is freed by an owning
  Transaction, pending Interrupt Mode PREEMPTs are first to be given Facility
  ownership, followed by previously preempted Transactions on the Interrupt
  Chain, followed by Transactions waiting normally in priority order on the
  Delay Chain. When a new owner is chosen from the Delay Chain or the Pending
  Chain, it enters the SEIZE or PREEMPT Block immediately, and then is scheduled
  by being placed on the CEC behind its priority peers.</p>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">Storage Entity Chains<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">Each Storage Entity has two Transaction chains. These
  chains are linked lists of Transactions:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">DELAY
    CHAIN - A priority chain of Transactions waiting for storage units.</p>
    </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
    <p ALIGN="left">·</font><font FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">RETRY
    CHAIN - A list of Transactions which are waiting for the status of the
    Storage Entity to change.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Delay Chain holds Transactions waiting for storage
  units. When a Transaction attempts to enter an ENTER Block on behalf of a
  Storage Entity, its storage demand is compared to the number of storage units
  available. The maximum available is defined in a STORAGE Command. If the
  storage demand cannot be satisfied, the Transaction is refused entry to the
  ENTER Block and is placed on the Delay Chain of the Storage in priority order.
  This causes the Transaction to come to rest in the simulation. A new Active
  Transaction is chosen. Then, when a Transaction gives up storage units, the
  Delay Chain is scanned in priority order, reactivating Transactions whose
  storage demands can be satisfied. A &quot;first fit with skip&quot; discipline
  is used. Each Transaction, in turn, is tested. If its demand can be satisfied
  it is allowed to enter the ENTER Block and is placed on the CEC behind its
  priority peers. If its demand cannot be satisfied, it remains on the Storage
  Entity’s Delay Chain.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Retry Chain is a list of Transactions waiting for a
  Storage Entity state change. These Transactions are reactivated when the
  Storage Entity changes from one state to another.</p>

  </font></b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">User Chains<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">Each Userchain Entity contains a Transaction chain called a
  User Chain. For a more detailed explanation of the entity type, Userchain,
  please refer to Chapter 4. Here we discuss the Transaction chain, called the
  User Chain, which is contained in each Userchain entity.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">User chains are linked lists of Transactions which have
  been removed from the Current Events Chain by a LINK Block. Traditionally,
  there have been two uses for User Chains.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">First, it is possible to implement extremely complex
  Transaction scheduling disciplines with User Chains. This can be done by
  assigning a numerical order value to a Transaction Parameter before LINKing
  the Transaction on a User Chain.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Second, older implementations of GPSS suggest that User
  Chains be used to avoid scheduling inefficiencies in the GPSS processor. This
  is less true in GPSS World because blocked Transactions do not remain on the
  CEC in GPSS World. However, it is still more efficient to avoid testing
  conditions which cannot possibly result in a successful test. In this case,
  you can place the blocked Transaction(s) on a User Chain until there is a
  possibility of success.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="9.2">9.2</a>. The Transaction
  Scheduler</h2>
  <p ALIGN="left">It is convenient to think of a GPSS simulation as a set of
  Transactions which occupy Blocks in a Block Diagram. Both the Block Input
  Window and the Blocks Window are essentially Block Diagrams. At any one time,
  every Transaction is in exactly one Block, but most Blocks may contain any
  number of Transactions. Each Transaction, in turn, gets an opportunity to move
  according to a prescribed path through the Block Diagram. When a Transaction
  is refused entry to a Block, it must wait in its current Block until
  conditions become favorable for its movement. The part of GPSS World that is
  responsible for this movement is called the Transaction Scheduler. Each Block
  type has its own routine which is executed when a Transaction attempts to
  enter that Block type. It is the job of the Transaction Scheduler to call the
  appropriate routine.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The first thing the Transaction Scheduler does is to
  identify the &quot;Active Transaction&quot;. If the CEC is not empty, the
  highest priority, head-of-line, Transaction on the CEC becomes the Active
  Transaction. If the CEC is empty, the Transaction Scheduler replenishes the
  CEC with the Transaction(s) from the FEC with the lowest time value. This
  action also updates the system clock.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Transaction Scheduler then tries to move the Active
  Transaction as far as it can in the simulation. In effect, the Transaction
  Scheduler removes the Active Transaction from the CEC, calls the routine for
  the next sequential Block (NSB), and unless something extraordinary occurs,
  replaces the Transaction in front of its peers (i.e. same priority) on the CEC.
  This gives higher priority Transactions a chance to move in the simulation.
  The CEC replacement can be modified by PRIORITY and BUFFER blocks. After a
  Transaction enters a BUFFER Block, it is replaced behind its peers on the CEC.
  BUFFER blocks are useful if a reactivated Transaction must get ahead of the
  Transaction which reactivated it. Other blocks can interfere with the
  replacement of a Transaction on the CEC. For example, ADVANCE(+) (i.e.
  positive time increment) calculates a scheduled time and places the
  Transaction on the FEC. Other blocks such as LINK, ENTER, SEIZE, and PREEMPT
  can cause the Active Transaction to come to rest on a Transaction Chain.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Removal from or replacement to the CEC has no effect on the
  system clock. The simulated time remains the same until there are no
  Transactions left on the CEC. Continual replacement of the Active Transaction
  on the CEC gives newly reactivated higher priority Transactions on the CEC a
  chance to become the Active Transaction. When the Active Transaction comes to
  rest on a Delay Chain or cannot move because of some other condition, the
  Transaction Scheduler chooses another Active Transaction and attempts to move
  it in the simulation.</p>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">The Movement of Transactions<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">Transactions must be on the CEC in order to move. Even
  PREEMPTed or DISPLACEd Transaction must become the Active Transaction before
  they can attempt entry into their new destination Block.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Since a Transaction may be refused entry into a Block, a
  Transaction scheduling may not lead to a Block entry. For this reason, most
  simulations have fewer Block entries than Transaction schedulings. On the
  other hand, EXECUTE blocks can cause additional Block entries.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When the Active Transaction attempts to enter a Block, the
  Transaction Scheduler calls the Block routine associated with the next Block
  type. It is the Block routine which decides whether or not the Transaction can
  enter the Block. Several Block types can refuse to allow the Transaction to
  enter. These are: ENTER, SEIZE, PREEMPT, GATE, TEST. In addition, if the
  Transaction has not cleared all its preemptions, it will be refused by
  ADVANCE(+) Blocks and will not be allowed to leave ASSEMBLE, GATHER, or MATCH
  Blocks.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">When the Active Transaction cannot enter any Block it is
  said to &quot;come to rest&quot; within the simulation. It is then removed
  from the CEC and placed on one of the Transaction chains discussed above.
  Then, a different Transaction is chosen to be the Active Transaction.</p>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">Blocking and Reactivation<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">The Active Transaction is &quot;blocked&quot; when it must
  wait for one or more entities to change state. GATE, TEST, TRANSFER BOTH, and
  TRANSFER ALL Blocks can require that specific conditions be met at one or more
  entities before the Active Transaction is allowed to proceed in the model.
  Each entity has a Retry Chain for Transactions which were blocked while trying
  to enter one of the above GPSS Blocks. When the state of the entity is changed
  by some other Transaction, all Transactions on the associated Retry Chain are
  replaced on the Current Events Chain behind their priority peers.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Reactivation is the movement of blocked Transactions to the
  CEC. If the Active Transaction changes the state of an entity, it is possible
  that one or more Transactions will be reactivated before the Active
  Transaction attempts to enter its next Block. If a higher priority Transaction
  is reactivated, it will become the Active Transaction. If you wish a newly
  reactivated Transaction to progress immediately, you must either place the
  active Transaction on the CEC behind its priority peers (BUFFER or PRIORITY
  Block, BU option), or you must cause the reactivated Transaction to have a
  higher priority than the old active Transaction. When a reactivated
  Transaction becomes the Active Transaction, the original blocking test is
  retried.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A Transaction is not permitted to be blocked on a test
  which will never be retried. This will lead to an Error Stop.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">If an entity state changes more than once before the system
  clock is updated, some states may not be detected. This can happen if the
  entity state is changed twice before the suspended blocked Transaction tests
  the condition. Usually, this possibility can be excluded by careful use of the
  BUFFER Block.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Do not use TEST or GATE Blocks in Refuse Mode, or TRANSFER
  (BOTH or ALL) to Block on User Variables. Transactions cannot be Blocked on
  Named Values because the latter do not have a Retry Chain. If you need to
  react to values achieved by an integrated variable, you should associate one
  or two Transaction generation thresholds with the User Variable. You can do
  this in the INTEGRATE Command. Otherwise, use a Savevalue Entity instead of a
  User Variable.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="9.3">9.3</a>. Synchronization</h2>
  <h3 ALIGN="left"><!--mstheme--><font color="#336666">Assembly Sets<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p ALIGN="left">An Assembly Set is a collection of Transactions.
  Transactions in the same Assembly Set are said to be related. When each
  Transaction is created, it is given an integer denoting its Assembly Set.
  Transactions created by GENERATE Blocks are given distinct integers starting
  with 1. Transactions created by SPLIT Blocks are given the Assembly Set of
  their parent.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A Transaction can change its Assembly Set by entering an
  ADOPT Block.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Assembly Sets are useful for causing synchronization among
  Transactions. It is easy to create, wait for, and destroy related Transactions
  in a simulation. This makes it easy to represent processes which at some point
  must wait for certain events to occur. The following GPSS blocks are used for
  that purpose:</p>

  <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="9.4">9.4</a>. Preemption and
  Displacement</h2>
  <p ALIGN="left">Preemption is the replacement of one Transaction which owns
  a Facility by another Transaction. The old Transaction is removed from
  ownership of the Facility and is placed on the Interrupt Chain of the
  Facility. The new Transaction becomes the owner of the Facility. Preemption
  occurs when a Transaction enters a PREEMPT Block, and differs depending on the
  mode of the PREEMPT Block.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">PREEMPT Blocks operate in either &quot;Priority Mode&quot;
  or &quot;Interrupt Mode&quot;. In either case, if a Transaction is preempted,
  it is placed on the Interrupt Chain of the Facility and ownership is given to
  the Active Transaction. However, the behavior of the two modes differs when
  the Active Transaction cannot gain ownership of the Facility. If the Active
  Transaction attempts to enter a Priority Mode PREEMPT Block, and the Facility
  is owned by another Transaction of equal or higher priority, the Active
  Transaction comes to rest on the Facility’s Delay Chain FIFO (first in,
  first out) within priority. If the Active Transaction attempts to enter an
  Interrupt Mode PREEMPT Block, and there already is a Transaction preempted at
  the Facility, the Active Transaction comes to rest on the Pending Chain of the
  Facility.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">PREEMPT and DISPLACE Blocks are provided to disrupt service
  periods. It is common to simulate a service time by having a Transaction SEIZE
  a Facility and then enter an ADVANCE Block with a positive time argument. When
  a Transaction is PREEMPTed at any Facility, or if it is DISPLACEd, if it is on
  the FEC it must be removed. This is done without changing the system clock.
  Since you may choose to continue a service period where you left off, a
  residual time is saved when a Transaction is removed from the FEC due to a
  DISPLACE, PREEMPT or FUNAVAIL Block entry. The residual time is the scheduled
  Transaction time (BDT) minus the current system clock time. This time is saved
  automatically and, in addition, it may be stored in a Transaction parameter.
  When the Transaction regains ownership of all Facilities for which it
  contends, it may be automatically rescheduled on the FEC using the residual
  time. If you choose, you may control this process explicitly by the options
  available in PREEMPT and FUNAVAIL statements.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A preempted Transaction cannot exist on the FEC. If a
  Transaction on the FEC is preempted, it is removed from the FEC and placed on
  a Facility’s Interrupt Chain. If a preempted Transaction attempts to enter
  an ADVANCE Block with a positive time increment, it is refused entry. When all
  preemptions have been cleared for a Transaction, it may then enter an
  ADVANCE(+) Block. If the PREEMPTed Transaction has been removed from
  contention for the Facility with the RE option of the PREEMPT Block, the
  preempted Transaction is not restricted from the FEC.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">Preempted Transactions can move through the simulation and
  can be preempted from any number of Facilities. A Transaction is represented
  on the Interrupt Chain of each Facility where it has been PREEMPTed. Since a
  PREEMPTed Transaction may still move through the simulation, a Transaction may
  be PREEMPTed from any number of Facilities at any one time. However, a
  Transaction cannot SEIZE or PREEMPT a Facility at which it is currently
  PREEMPTed.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A Transaction may be displaced from one Block and moved to
  another. If a Transaction is on the FEC, CEC, a Delay Chain, a Pending Chain,
  or a User Chain and is PREEMPTed by a PREEMPT Block with a C operand, or is
  displaced by a DISPLACE Block, it is removed from the original chain,
  scheduled for a new Block, and placed on the CEC.</p>
  <p ALIGN="left">A preempted Transaction, which is still in contention for a
  Facility, cannot enter a TERMINATE Block. Such Transactions must enter a
  RELEASE or RETURN Block before they are permitted to TERMINATE. Alternately,
  if you intend to TERMINATE a preempted Transaction, you could remove the
  Transaction from contention for the Facility using the RE option in the
  PREEMPT Block.</p>
